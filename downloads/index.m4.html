<h3>The Continental Drift Observation Project
	<p>
		This is a programme whereby
		students of secondary school age (eleven to eighteen years)
		go out once a year and use an accurate GNSS receiver
		to measure the position of a chosen fixed point.
		All continents are moving due to continental drift
		and the equipment is accurate enough to detect this
		over a few years.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm based in the UK.
		The Eurasian continent is moving at about three centimetres per year
		and the equipment is accurate to about three centimetres.
		When students here take their third measurement,
		they will see that their fixed point has moved about six centimetres
		from their first measurement,
		two years earlier.
		This is well outside the resolution of the equipment,
		so it's clear that the ground they stand on is moving.
		Over their remaining school career
		they will see that the ground is moving steadily north-east.
		Meanwhile
		they will learn the necessary mathematics and Geography
		to understand what's going on.
		If they study physics they will also learn
		how the measuring equipment works.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rate and direction of drift on other continents is different,
		but potentially this experiment can be done in schools
		anywhere in the world on solid ground.
