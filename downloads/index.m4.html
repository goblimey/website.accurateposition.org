	The Continental Drift Observation Project is a programme whereby
	students of secondary school age (eleven to eighteen years)
	go out once a year and use an accurate GNSS receiver
	to measure the position of a chosen fixed point.
	In Europe, they would see the effect of the drift
	after two years,
	when they take their third measurement..
	Over their remaining school career
	they see that the Eurasian
	continent is moving north-east at about three centimetres per year.
	Meanwhile, they will learn the necessary mathematics,
	physics and geography
	to understand what's going on.

	The rate of drift on other continents is different,
	but potentially this could be done
