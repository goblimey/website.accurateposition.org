<h3>The Continental Drift Observation Project</h3>
<p>
	All of the continents are moving slowly but steadily
	due to continental drift.
	GNSS receivers are accurate enough to detect
	this movement over a few years
	and recently they have become cheap enough
	to be used in schools.
</p>
<p>
	In this project,
	students of secondary school age (eleven to eighteen years)
	will use accurate GNSS equipment to measure
	the rate of drift of the ground under their feet.
