	The Continental Drift Observation Project is a programme whereby
	students of secondary school age (11-18)
	go out once a year and use an accurate GNSS receiver
	to measure the position of a chosen fixed point.
	In Europe, they see the effect of the drift
	after two years.
	Over their remaining school career
	they see that the Eurasian
	continent is moving north-east at about three centimetres per year.
