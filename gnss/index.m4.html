<h2>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)</h2>
<p>
    GNSS is a generic term for a group ("constellation")
    of satellites that send out radio signals which
    help a receiver to find its position.
    The first and best known constellation
    was the American Global Position System (GPS)
    but there are now four constellations of navigation satellites
    that cover the whole of the Earth - GPS, the Russian Glonass,
    the Chinese BeiDou and the European Union's Galileo.
    Some satellites from each of those constellations should be
    visible from any point on the Earth's surface
    with a clear view of the sky.
    There are other constellations that give limited coverage.
</p>
<p>
    GNSS receivers are available that can use the data from
    any or all of these satellites to find their position.

    Greg Milner's book
    "Pinpoint â€“ How GPS is Changing Technology, Culture, and Our Minds"
    (pub Granta 2016)
    is a very readable history of the GPS system.

<p>
    The use of a GNSS receiver to find a route
    to some destination is well-known.
    Satellite Navigation (SatNav) systems
    have been used by drivers, sailors and pedestrians for many years
    and nowadays the same technology is built into smartphones.
    A SatNav
    contains a GNSS Receiver,
    a digital map
    stored using some sort of Graphical Information System (GIS)
    and a sophisticated piece of software that keeps track
    of where the device is within the map
    and figures out a good route from there
    to wherever its user wants to end up.
</p>
<p>
    Other types of GNSS receiver are used just to find
    the device's current position.
    These are used for applications such as land surveying.
</p>
<p>
    A single GNSS device can find its position to within about
    three metres.
    That's adequate for a SatNav
    but land surveying needs more accuracy.
    As we will see,
    Survey-quality GNSS devices
    have been around for twenty years or more.
    They used to be very expensive and initially only
    large organisations could afford to use them.
    The UK's mapping authority
    the Ordnance Survey
    was an early adopter.
    Over the last few years,
    prices have fallen dramatically
    and accurate GNSS devices are now available
    for a few hundred dollars,
    making it feasible for a local architect,
    a builder
    or an individual enthusiast like me to use them.
</p>
<p>
    I'm working on a proposal wherein
    young people (aged eleven to eighteen years)
    will use accurate GNSS receivers to measure
    the effects of continental drift.
