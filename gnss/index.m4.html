<h2>Global Navigation Satellite Systems</h2>
<p>
    Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
    is the generic term for a group ("constellation")
    of satellites that send out radio signals which
    help a receiver to find its position.
</p>
<p>
    The American Global Position System (GPS)
    was the first of these
    but there are now four constellations of navigation satellites,
    each covering the whole of the Earth - GPS, the Russian Glonass,
    the Chinese BeiDou and the European Union's Galileo.
    Some satellites from these constellations should be
    visible from any point on the Earth's surface
    with a clear view of the sky.
    There are other constellations that cover limited areas
    of the planet.
</p>
<p>
    Greg Milner's book
    "Pinpoint â€“ How GPS is Changing Technology, Culture, and Our Minds"
    (pub Granta 2016)
    is a very readable history of the GPS system.
</p>
<p>
    To find its position,
    a GNSS receiver must receive at least
    one signal each from four satellites.
    Receivers are available that can use the data from
    any or all of the constellations to find their position.
</p>
<p>
    I have a GNSS receiver in my garden shed.
    As I write,
    it has just received:
<ul>
    <li>10 signals from 5 GPS satellites</li>
    <li>12 signals from 6 Galileo satellites</li>
    <li>16 signals from 11 BeiDou satellites</li>
    <li>10 signals from 5 Glonass satellites</li>
</ul>
So at that time, 27 satellites were visible to my receiver.
We are surrounded by other houses,
which restricts our view of the sky.
A receiver with an unrestricted view should see even more satellites
at any time.
The weather today is cloudy,
which may reduce the signal reception a little more.
</p>


<p>
    One use of a GNSS receiver is well-known.
    A
    Satellite Navigation (SatNav) system
    contains a GNSS Receiver,
    a digital map
    stored using some sort of Graphical Information System (GIS)
    and a sophisticated piece of software that keeps track
    of where the device is
    and figures out a good route from there
    to wherever its user wants to get to.
    SatNavs have been used by drivers, sailors and pedestrians for many years
    and nowadays the technology is built into smartphones.
</p>
<p>
    Other types of GNSS receiver are used just to find
    the device's current position.
    These are used for applications such as land surveying.
</p>
<p>
    A single GNSS device can find its position to within about
    three metres.
    That's adequate for a SatNav
    but land surveying needs more accuracy.
    Using extra equipment,
    two or three centimetre accuracy is typical
    and millimetre accuracy is possible.
</p>
<p>
    Survey-grade GNSS devices
    have been around since the 1990s.
    They used to be very expensive and initially only
    large organisations could afford to use them.
    The UK's mapping authority
    the Ordnance Survey
    was an early adopter.
    Ordnance Survey maps have been
    based on GNSS surveys for twenty years or more.
</p>
<p>
    Over the last few years,
    prices have fallen dramatically
    and now (in 2024)
    centimetre-accurate GNSS devices are available
    for a few hundred dollars,
    making it feasible for a local architect,
    a builder
    or an individual enthusiast like me to buy them.
</p>
<p>
    They can be used for all sorts of purposes.
    I'm working on a proposal whereby
    young people (aged eleven to eighteen years)
    will use accurate GNSS receivers to measure
    the effects of continental drift.
</p>
<p>
    Although the equipment is now cheap,
    it can be quite difficult to figure
    out how to use it properly.
    Fixing that is one of the purposes of
    this website.
