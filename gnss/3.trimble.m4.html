<h2>Trimble</h2>
<p>
    Greg Milner's book <b><i>Pinpoint</i></b>
    explains that Charlie Trimble,
    an electronics engineer and amateur sailor,
    was one of the first people to spot the commercial
    potential of the then emerging GPS system.
    He founded Trimble Navigation,
    initially developing SatNavs for boats and cars
    and later developing a range of accurate
    GNSS systems for land surveying.
    I use Trimble's entry-level survey device, the Catalyst.
</p>
<p>
    (Trimble
    is not the only supplier of survey-standard equipment,
    there are lots of others,
    but I only talk here about stuff that I've used.)
</p>
<p>
    Trimble's survey equipment uses their own proprietary protocols
    and their own RTK network.
    Access to the network is by subscription,
    either monthly or by the hour.
</p>
<p>
    My Trimble Catalyst,
    is described as a GNSS Antenna.
    It's designed to screw onto a standard surveyor's pole
    or tripod
    and it uses a smartphone
    to provide the signal processing,
    the display and the Internet connection.
    It only works with an Android phone,
    which is a nuisance if you already have
    an Apple device.
</p>
<p>
    Without a base station
    it can find its position to within about 3 metres,
    within a few seconds in good conditions.
    When connected to the Trimble RTK network,
    the accuracy improves to two or three centimetres.
</p>

<p>
    The subscription to the Trimble RTK network
    costs about $300 per month (check the Trimble website for the current figure).
    For a professional surveyor this makes sense as you can get
    2 to 3 centimetre accuracy across Europe and the USA
    and some level of increased accuracy anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
    Trimble also sells on-demand access to their RTK network.
    You can buy blocks of ten or one hundred hours of time.
    Each time you connect to the RTK network, you burn one of your hours.
    At the end of the hour,
    it asks if you want to burn another,
    and so on.
    In the UK they cost £12 per block including VAT,
    so £120 minimum purchase.
    I'm not a professional surveyor
    and I only need to use my Catalyst occasionally,
    so I use their on-demand service.
</p>
<p>
    Just to be clear,
    the Cat (and any other Trimble product)
    only works accurately when connected to their RTK service,
    which costs money.
    If the RTK service provided by Trimble
    in your region don't give you centimetre accuracy,
    you can supply your own NTRIP feed (see later)
    <b><i>but</i></b> only via the Trimble network,
    at the same subscription price.
</p>
<p>
    The Catalyst is Trimble's entry level product.
    It does a great job,
    but it can be defeated by tree cover
    or even just cloud.
    I used it recently
    and I had a fairly open view of the sky,
    well away from trees,
    but there was a very thin covering of cloud.
    I had to wait for three or four minutes
    before the device
    received signals from enough satellites to work.
    Other times under what looked like similar conditions,
    it gave me a fix much more rapidly.
    If you want to do serious work and your time is valuable,
    you may want to try the Trimble service using a Catalyst
    and then upgrade to one of their more expensive offerings.
</p>
<p>
    Using the Catalyst has taught me some some useful lessons.
</p>
<p>
    Currently I can only buy
    a block of RTK hours through
    a Trimble dealer,
    in the case of the UK, that's
    <a href='https://www.korecgroup.com/'>Korec</a>,
    who also supplied my Catalyst.
    Lovely people and very helpful throughout.
    but buying a block of hours from them
    is a manual process
    and takes time.
    So, when you need a block of hours
    to do some work,
    don't wait until the last minute
    to buy it.
</p>
<p>
    Trimble have an online licence server
    that manages the blocks you've bought.

<p>
    The Cat only works if it can receive signals
    from enough satellites - four, as described earlier.
    If you log in to the RTK network
    but you don't have enough satellite
    coverage,
    <b><i>you still burn one of your hours</i></b>.
    Always check that you can get an uncorrected fix first,
    then log in and start burning money.
</p>
<p>
    Once you connect,
    you may still get messages for a few minutes
    saying that it can't see any satellites,
    even you could a minute ago.
    Be patient, it can take time.
</p>
<p>
    My model has a cable wired into it with a USB B plug on the other end.
    That's to plug into the phone and connect to the apps,
    but my phone is USB C.
    Trimble supply a converter cable,
    but as always that makes the connection a bit flaky.
    The app often complains that
    it's lost connectivity.
    Unplug the converter cable
    and plug it in again.
</p>
<p>
    (USB C is becoming the standard for phones,
    so Trimble may have reworked the cable by now.)
</p>
<p>
    The Cat has no internal battery.
    It can take power from your phone,
    but that you may want to avoid that drain.
    There's a USB B socket
    that takes power
    via a second cable.
    You can use a mobile phone power bank
    and you get a small power bank with the cat.
    I use a bigger one with higher capacity.
    I carry two so that I can also keep the phone
    charged up.
</p>
<p>
    You control the Cat using the Trimble Mobile Manager app
    on your Android phone.
    When you install that,
    the Trimble Catalyst App is also installed automatically.
    It does the signal processing
    but you never interact with it directly.
    Both apps are free.
</p>
<p>
    Trimble release new versions of both apps regularly
    and you need to keep them up to date
    or things may stop working.
    I discovered this when they changed their authentication
    mechanism
    and the old version of the app could no longer log in to the RTK network.
    No error message saying why,
    It just looked as if I was supplying the wrong password.
    You don't want this sort of problem
    when you're out doing a survey,
    so before you go out,
    check for updates to both apps.
</p>
<p>
    When you buy a block of hours,
    they don't work until you activate them.
    If you buy ten on-demand hours and activate them,
    after 12 months they expire and evaporate. <b>No refund</b>.
    I read somewhere that if you don't activate them,
    they activate themselves after three months,
    and then evaporate a year later.
    Don't buy a block of hours until you need it
</p>
<p>
    You can view the state of your on-demand hours using Trimble's
    <a href='https://license-manager.trimble.com/licenses'>License Manager</a>
    website.
    Log in using the same account name and password
    that you use to connect your device to the correction network.
    The license Manager shows you
    how many of your block of hours are left.
    To see when the block expires,
    use the Purchase History link at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
    (I recently met reps from Korec and Trimble
    at a trade show and I lobbied them,
    pointing out that (a)
    they should sell the hours through a web page
    and (b) having the hours evaporate
    after a year is a tad annoying.
    Apparently,
    allowing them to run for longer
    creates an accounting problem,
    but that doesn't seem to me to justify
    the practice.)
