<h2>RTCM</h2>


<p>
    The Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM)
    produced a standard protocol for sending satellite
    observation data over a data link.
    The protocol is also called RTCM.
    It allows a base station from one manufacturer to
    send signal data to a rover from
    another manufacturer.
    The RTCM protocol is currently at version 3.
</p>
<p>
    See later for more details of RTCM.
</p>
<p>
    Trimble equipment uses Trimble's own protocols.
    It can also use RTCM,
    <b><i>but</i></b> only via Trimble's network,
    so you still have to pay the subscription.
    If you are in a part of the world
    where Trimble's own correction service
    can't provide centimetre accuracy,
    you can use an RTCM feed to drive your Trimble device.
</p>
<p>
    Other manufacturers' equipment uses RTCM
    over radio or the Internet,
    so you there's no running cost.
    I've used equipment from Emlid
    and SparkFun
    that works that way.
</p>

<h2>NTRIP</h2>

<p>
    The base station can send out its observations using
    Long Range Radio (LoRa) as the data link.
    In theory,
    any rover within a few kilometres should be able to pick up the signal
    but LoRa systems can be plagued by interference.
    which work up high
    with line of sight to to the base station.
    My experience of using LoRa
    to drive a survey device on the ground is not so good.
</p>
<p>
    If your base and rover both have a handy Internet connection,
    the base can send the signal data over the Internet using NTRIP
    (Networked Transmission of RTCM using Internet Protocols).
    It's a fairly simple streaming data protocol,
    similar in concept to the protocols that
    companies like Netflix use to stream programmes
    to your TV.
</p>
<p>
    If your base station is in your office
    it can use your business broadband connection.
    The load it puts on the network is very low.
    I run a base station from my garden shed
    sending to the outside world via my home
    broadband connection.
</p>
<p>
    A rover used for surveying typically uses a nearby
    mobile phone as an Internet modem.
</p>
<p>
    A device on the Internet is easy to find
    if it has a published domain name.
    To avoid the rover having to find
    the base station,
    the two communicate via a
    piece of software
    called a <b><i>caster</i></b> (a broadcaster)
    running on a server with a fixed IP address and a
    published domain name.
</p>
<p>
    The caster is a specialist
    web server and uses the <b><i>publisher/subscriber</i></b>
    model.
    It offers a set of named <b><i>endpoints</i></b>.
    The base station publishes its signal data
    by sending them to one of the caster's endpoints.
    A rover subscribes to the same endpoint
    and receives the stream of data that the base station sends.
</p>
<pre>
    NTRIP
                                                  ---> rover
------------                   --------   NTRIP  /
| NTRIP base |     NTRIP      | NTRIP  | -------/
| station    | -------------> | caster |        \
------------                   --------          \
                                                  ---> rover
</pre>
<p>
    The caster's home page lists its mountpoints,
    one per line,
    with information such as the mountpoint's location
    and the RTCM messages in its data stream.
    (For UK mountpoints,
    look for "GBR" in the country field.)
</p>
<p>
    The signals are sent by the satellites every second.
    The base station receives them
    and sends them to the endpoint
    in a stream of RTCM messages.
    More than one rover can subscribe to the same endpoint.
    When a rover is running it sends
    a series of http requests to its caster,
    asking for any recent data on its chosen endpoint.
</p>


<p>
    The <a href="">International GNSS Service(IGS)</a>
    coordinates an international network
    of NTRIP base stations and casters.
    They claim that these have very precise locations,
    down to millimetre accuracy.
    The service is free but you need to apply for an account
    <a href="https://igs.org/rts/user-access/">here</a>.
    The IGS caster for Europe is
    <a href="https://euref-ip.net/">euref-ip.net</a>.
    Looking at the home page,
    currently (in 2023) there are four IGS base stations
    in the UK.
    My nearest is run by Imperial College in London.
    The others are in
    Herstmonceux in East Sussex,
    Daresbury in Cheshire,
    and Inverness in Scotland.
</p>
<p>
    The base station publishes its position
    in the stream of messages
    and the rover works out its position relative
    to that.
    The base position is bound to some
    reference frame,
    so the rover inherits that.
    According to
    <a href="http://acc.igs.org/igs-frames.html">this link</a>,
    since 2017 the IGS base stations have published their position
    within the International
    Terrestrial Reference Frame ITRF2014,
    so your rover will inherit that.
    You don't inherit a geoid model from the base,
    so you have to choose a sensible one.
    GEOID18 is a good match for ITRF2014.
</p>
<p>
    (So if I want to compare positions
    measured with a Trimble device
    and a rover driven by an IGS base station,
    I should set the Trimble's reference frame
    to ITRF2014 and its geoid to GEOID18.)
</p>
<p>
    The NTRIP protocol is currently at version 2.
    Some base stations and casters
    still work at version 1 of the protocol.
    The NTRIP standard specifies
    that a rover should be able to use either version
    and detect when it connects
    which version the caster is using.
</p>
<p>
    You can run your own caster.
    NTRIP was invented by the
    German organisation
    Bundesamt für Kartographieund Geodäsie (BKG) -
    in English, the Federal Agency for
    Cartography and Geodesy.
    To show how it can be used,
    they published an open-source caster.
    Originally it was free.
</p>
<p>
    They still maintain this software, but they charge
    1,000 Euros for the latest version.
    You can get that
    <a href=' https://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/bkgcaster.'>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can find a copy of the earlier free version
    <a href='https://github.com/nunojpg/ntripcaster'>here</a>.
    To use it, you need to understand
    how to build it from its source code and
    install it on a server.
</p>
<p>
    The Docker system makes it much easier to build
    and install software
    so I support a version of BKG's caster that runs under Docker.
    You can find that
    <a href='https://github.com/goblimey/ntripcaster/'>here</a>
    You will find full instruction on how to build and configure it
    later.
