<h2>Geographical Coordinate Systems</h2>
<p>
    GNSS systems report positions using all sorts of conventions,
    so we have to look at the different ways that a position
    can be represented.
</p>
<p>
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf'>
        This guide
    </a>
    from the UK's mapping authority
    The Ordnance Survey (OS)
    gives an excellent introduction.
</p>
<p>
    The OS also run
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation/'>
        this web page
    </a>
    which converts a position
    expressed in one coordinate system
    into all the others.
    (Beware: accuracy is limited!)
</p>
<p>
    For use offline, the OS offers
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/projection-and-transformation-calculations.xls'>
        this spreadsheet tool
    </a>
    which does similar conversions,
    (maybe more accurately,
    I haven't checked yet).
</p>
<p>
    What follows is my take on the subject.
</p>
<h3>The Shape of the Earth</h3>
<p>
    According to
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis#:~:text=Astronomers%20think%20the%20collision%20between,Earth%20was%20nearly%20fully%20formed">
        current theories
    </a>
    the Earth and the Moon were
    formed about 4.5 billion years ago
    when two planets collided.
    The heat generated by the impact
    caused the two bodies to melt
    and then merge.
    Some of the material was ejected and coalesced to form the Moon.
</p>
<p>
    The resulting Earth has a solid core at the centre,
    mainly iron,
    very hot but under huge pressure,
    which stops it from melting.
    Beyond that is more iron,
    but liquid.
    Te rotation of which generates the Earth's magnetic field.
    Further out from the centre is the mantle,
    essentially a hot gooey mess of rock,
    flowing like a very viscous liquid.
    The solid surface crust floats on top of the mantle.
</p>
<p>
    The crust is broken into large plates
    which move around slowly,
    pushed and pulled by convection currents in the mantle.
</p>
<p>
    The material in one of the original two planets was
    a little denser than
    the material in the other and there are still huge lumps
    of this denser material slowly moving around,
    deep below the surface.
    On the surface,
    the tides move huge volumes of water
    backwards and forwards during the day.
    Even a nearby mountain can have enough material
    in it to deflect local gravity slightly.
    These and other factors
    cause local gravity to be uneven
    so that it doesn't always pull directly towards the centre of mass
    of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
    The result of all this is this is that nothing
    on the Earth is fixed.
    There's no solid ground.
    There's a thin shell,
    relatively solid,
    around a huge boiling maelstrom of
    molten fluid.
    Convection currents deep inside stir up the material,
    causing the continents on the surface to move around and
    change shape very slowly.

</p>
<h3>The Rate of Continental Drift</h3>

<p>
    The Earth's crust is composed of <b><i>tectonic plates</i></b>
    which move around the surface slowly
    due to
    <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/continental-drift/">
        continental drift
    </a>.
    The part of the European plate
    that I live on moves against
    longitude and latitude
    at about 2.5 cm per year
    heading approximately north-east.
    Meanwhile the USA moves in a different direction
    and the two plates are moving apart at about 3cm per year.
    Iceland sits at the point where the two plates part
    which causes all sorts of geophysical effects,
    some quite violent.
</p>
<p>
    This slow movement didn't matter so much
    before accurate GNSS equipment came along,
    but now it can be detected
    using equipment costing only a few hundred dollars.
</p>

<h3>The Ellipsoid</h3>
<p>
    The Earth is held together by its own gravity and is almost,
    but not quite, a sphere.
    It spins on an axis,
    which stretches it very slightly at the Equator and
    shrinks it very slightly at the poles,
    making it approximately an ellipsoid.
</p>
<p>
    Geographers have defined a perfect ellipsoid
    that's close on average to the Earth's real shape.
    It's called <b><i>the Ellipsoid</i></b>
    (capital E).
</p>
<p>
    The Ellipsoid is not always a convenient tool
    for making maps,
    and some cartographers
    define other ellipsoids
    that better approximate the shape of
    the locality that they are interested in.
</p>
<p>
    Because a geographical ellipsoid
    is very close to a sphere,
    up until the 1960s at least,
    the UK Ordnance Survey referred to it as a
    <b><i>Spheroid</i></b>.
    In 1830,
    the British Astronomer Royal
    George Airy defined the <b><i>Airy Spheroid</i></b>
    based on a Prime Meridian
    set by astronomy carried out at the Greenwich Observatory.
    In 1936
    the OS defined the OSGB36 coordinate system,
    based on Airy's spheroid.
    They still use OSGB36 for their paper maps.
    More on that
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/ostn15-new-geoid-britain'>
        Here
    </a>
</p>
<h3>The Geoid</h3>
<p>
    As already mentioned,
    gravity doesn't always point at the centre of mass of the Earth.
    There's another solid shape called <b><i>The Geoid</i></b>
    (which just means "Earth-shaped" in Latin).
</p>
<p>
    Where the land meets the sea.
    the Geoid is approximately
    at mean sea level,
    so it's a more formal version
    of that concept.
</p>

<p>
    According to Wikipedia:
    "The
    Geoid is the shape that the ocean surface
    would take under the influence of the gravity of Earth, including
    gravitational attraction and Earth's rotation,
    if other influences such as winds and tides were absent.
    This surface
    is extended through the continents."
</p>

<p>
    You can find more about The Geoid
    <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-geoid-why-do-we-use-it-and-where-does-its-shape-come">
        here
    </a>.

</p>
<p>
    As with ellipsoids,
    mapmakers often define their own geoids
    which more closely match their local conditions.
</p>
<p>
    To sum up, the Ellipsoid is a <i>regular</i> solid that approximates to the shape of the Earth
    and the Geoid is an <i>irregular</i> solid that also approximates to the shape of the Earth.
    The two are designed to work globally
    but local ellipsoids and geoids can
    approximate the local landscape more
    conveniently for local maps.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Latitude and Longitude</h3>
<p>
    Geographers divide up the Ellipsoid using the familiar
    imaginary lines of longitude and latitude.
    A position on the surface of the Ellipsoid
    can be specified in degrees, minutes and seconds
    of longitude and latitude.
    A minute is one sixtieth of a degree of arc
    and a second is one sixtieth of a minute.
</p>
<p>
    The lines of
    <a href='https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/latitude.html'>latitude</a>
    (or "parallels") are circles
    running east-west
    around the Ellipsoid.
    The Equator is the line of latitude
    equidistant
    from the north and south poles.
    That's zero latitude.
    The circles of latitude are different sizes.
    The Equator is the biggest and
    the circles of latitude get smaller
    the closer you get to one of the poles.
</p>
<p>
    The circles of latitude are
    labelled by degrees running from -90 degrees at the south pole
    through zero at the Equator
    and +90 degrees at the north pole.
    The city of Newcastle upon Newcastle-upon-Tyne
    in the UK
    is roughly on the line of latitude at 55 degrees.
    So your latitude tells you how far north or south
    you are from the Equator.
</p>
<p>
    The lines of
    <a href='https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/longitude.html'>longitude</a>
    (or "meridians")
    are lines running north-south from
    the north pole to the south pole around
    the Ellipsoid.
    Because the earth is ellipsoidal rather than a sphere,
    these are ellipses, not circles.
    They are all the same length.
    The Prime Meridian runs through
    the grounds of Greenwich Observatory in London.
    It has a longitude of zero degrees.
    Your longitude tells you how far east or west
    you are from the Prime Meridian.
</p>




<p>
    The poles, the equator
    and the positions of the lines of latitude,
    are real objects, arising from the Earth's rotation.
    In contrast,
    the position of the prime meridian is <i>entirely arbitrary</i>.
    It's wherever people agree that it is.
    The Greenwich Observatory was set up by the
    British Admiralty,
    who ran what was at the time the
    world's most powerful navy.
    They decided where the prime meridian would lie and
    everybody else accepted it.
</p>
<p>
    The French government had
    their own favourite meridian,
    which ran through the Paris Observatory.
    In its first version,
    the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre'>metre</a>
    was defined as one ten millionth of the distance
    from the Equator to the North Pole
    along that meridian.
    Actually, that distance changes as the Earth changes shape,
    so the definition has been refined
    using more stable metrics.
</p>
<p>
    If France had won the Napoleonic Wars,
    we would probably have all accepted
    that meridian as the line of zero longitude.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, the Greenwich Observatory
    has moved the prime meridian around its grounds
    several times
    over the years and
    in any case it moves all the time due to continental drift.
</p>
<p>
    That didn't used to matter because
    most surveying equipment
    wasn't accurate enough to notice,
    but now that we have GNSS receivers accurate to
    two or three centimetres,
    it does matter.
    In fact,
    it's become convenient to
    define several versions of latitude and longitude,
    each with meridians in different places.
</p>
<p>
    <a
        href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/society/politics-policy-people/geography/diy-measuring-latitude-and-longitude#:~:text=The%20Earth%20rotates%20one%20full,noon%20at%20the%20Prime%20Meridian.">
        This page
    </a>
    from the UK Open University explains
    how to use some very simple equipment
    to find your longitude and latitude
    relative to the Prime Meridian
    and the Equator.
    The more accurate your measuring equipment
    and clock,
    the more accurate will be your result.
</p>

<h3>Longitude, Latitude and Distance</h3>

<p>
    If my GNSS equipment gives me the longitude and latitude
    of two position,
    how far apart are they
    along the curved surface of the Ellipsoid?
</p>
<p>
    One important point to understand
    about all measuring equipment
    is that just because a gadget
    displays its
    result to lots of decimal places,
    doesn't mean that it is that accurate.
</p>
<p>
    My Trimble Catalyst GNSS receiver
    is accurate to two or three centimetres.
    It displays its position in degrees, minutes and seconds,
    and the seconds value is displayed to eight decimal places,
    That's far better resolution
    than the equipment can actually manage.
    We'll see that you can ignore all but the first few
    decimal places of the seconds part of
    the coordinates.
</p>
<h4>Distance Along a Line of Longitude</h4>
<p>
    For rough purposes
    we can pretend that the Ellipsoid is a sphere,
    which it almost is,
    so all the meridians are circles of the same length.
    The earth has radius 6,371,000 metres, diameter 12,742,000 metres.
    The circumference of a circle is
    <br><br>
    diameter X pi
    <br><br>
    so
    the circumference of a meridian is about 40,000,000 metres.
</p>

<p>
    On a meridian,
    a difference of latitude of one degree
    covers about 111,111 metres
    That's worked out as follows:
</p>
<p>
    Note that there are 360 degree or
    1,296,000 seconds in a circle.
    These circles are 40,000,000 metres around,
    so:
<ul>
    <li>one degree covers about 111,111 metres</li>
    <li>one minute covers about 1,851 metres</li>
    <li>one second covers about 31 metres</li>
    <li>0.001 seconds covers about
        three centimetres</li>
    <li>0.0001 seconds covers about
        three millimetres</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
    In a test with my Trimble Catalyst device
    fixed in one place,
    the degrees and minutes values for the latitude
    remained steady,
    as you would expect,
    given the resolution.
    The seconds value
    varied from 11.6873 to 11.6875.
    That represents a range of about
    six millimetres in my position north to south.
</p>

<h4>Distance Along a Line of Latitude</h4>
<p>
    The lines of latitude are circles of different sizes
    so the calculation a little bit more complicated.
</p>
<p>
    I live in the UK, which lies between
    the 50 degree parallel and the 60 degree parallel.
    Our nation is small enough that for a rough estimate
    we can work out
    the length of one parallel and use that result
    everywhere.
    55 degrees latitude is in the middle of the UK.
    That's about the position of the fair
    city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
    (According to Wikipedia,
    the centre of Newcastle is at 54.9783 degrees latitude).
</p>
<p>
    To work out the length of the 55 degree parallel,
    use this picture:
</p>
<p>
    <img srcset='/images/longitudinal.distance/longitudinal.distance.100.jpg 100w,
    /images/longitudinal.distance/longitudinal.distance.200.jpg 200w,
    https://accurateposition.org/images/longitudinal.distance/longitudinal.distance.400.jpg 400w' sizes=' (max-width: 160px) 100px, (max-width: 360px) 200px, (max-width: 400px)
    513px, 513px' alt='a circle with a radius drawn at an angle of 55 degrees'>
</p>
<p>
    We're interested in the length r,
    which is the radius of the 55 degree parallel.
</p>
<p>
    The hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle in the picture
    is a radius of the circle.
    Newcastle is at the end of that line.
    The Earth has radius 6,371,000 metres
    so that's the length of that line.
</p>
<p>
    The sine of an angle is:
    <br><br>
    (length of opposite side) divided by (length of hypotenuse),
    <br><br>
    so given the angle 35 degrees
    we can work out r.
    I get 3,654,255 metres.
</p>
<p></p>
The circumference of a circle of radius r is
</p>
<p>
    2 X pi X r
</p>
<p>
    A spreadsheet will work the whole thing out for you.
    Microsoft Excel's sine function works in radians,
    not degrees.
    To convert the angle to radians,
    multiply by pi/180.
</p>
<p>
    If my mathematical working is correct,
    you can use this Excel formula to calculate the
    circumference of the 55 degree parallel:
</p>
<p>
    =(SIN(35*PI()/180)*6371000*2*PI())
</p>
<p>
    which gives me about 22,960,364 metres for the UK,
    roughly half the circumference of one of the meridians.
</p>
<p>
    Dividing that by 360 X 60 X 60
    gives the distance covered by
    one second of in the UK -
    about 18 metres.
    So 0.001 seconds of latitude here covers
    about 2 centimetres east to west,
    and 0.0001 seconds covers about two millimetres.
</p>
<p>
    If my GNSS receiver is accurate to two or three centimetres
    and I'm working in the UK,
    I should believe the first two decimal places
    of the seconds value of the longitude,
    be a bit suspicious
    of the third decimal place.
</p>
<p>
    In my test,
    the value for longitude varied
    from 9.7803 seconds to 9.7808 seconds.
    In terms of distance those values range over
    about a centimetre.
</p>


As well as latitude and longitude,
the Catalyst displays its
<b><i>orthonometric</i></b> height
(the height above the Geoid).
Apparently this will figure will usually be less
accurate than the other two,
maybe 5 centimetres rather than two or three.
In my test,
the height value
varied from 201.77 metres
to 201.78 metres,
so it ranged over one centimetre.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Vertical and Horizontal</h3>
<p>
    As we will see,
    some concepts that we think
    are very simple and obvious
    turn out out to be a little more complicated.
    The concept of something being
    "vertically above" something else,
    is an example.
    In the Eighteenth Century,
    Nevil Maskelyne,
    the UK's Astronomer Royal,
    showed that a plumb line
    close to an isolated mountain
    will deviate slightly from the vertical
    due to the gravitational pull of the nearby huge mass of rock.
</p>
<p>
    This was a nuisance to astronomers because
    they used plumb lines and baths of mercury
    to align their telescopes,
    assuming that the plumb line would be vertical
    and the surface of the mercury would be horizontal.
    They could work out the position of their telescope
    by taking sighting of celestial objects,
    but a deviation in local gravity of just a few seconds
    would put the result out by metres.
</p>
<p>
    To make matters worse,
    we now know that you don't need a nearby mountain
    to interfere with your.
    The tides and those big lumps of
    denser matter under the surface
    also mess things up.

</p>
<p>
    Sure enough, this is exactly what happened in 1830
    when
    George Airy's team at the Greenwich Observatory
    measured the position
    of the prime meridian and put a
    mark on the ground
    showing where they thought it was.
    Greenwich is a long way from the nearest mountain,
    but the mark was about 100 metres from the correct position.
    Read about that
    <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/geography/prime-meridian-wrong.html">
        here
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Since the line was fixed
    the ground beneath it has moved
    again by about a few more metres
    due to continental drift.
</p>
<p>
    If your plumb line doesn't show you the vertical,
    then what does?
    This was one reason for the invention of the Geoid.
</p>

<p>
    Page 16 of
    <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf/">
        the OS Guide
    </a>
    discusses this issue.
    That guide also explains why
    national mapmakers define other ellipsoids
    that approximate better
    to their local landscape.
</p>
<p>
    The Ordnance Survey ran a complete re-survey of the UK
    from 1935 to 1962.
    At the end they produced a 400 page report
    that you can download
    <a
        href='https://storage.googleapis.com/retriangulation/The%20History%20of%20the%20Retriangulation%20of%20Great%20Britain%201935-1962.pdf'>
        here
    </a>.
    Among other things,
    it describes how
    they used telescopes at the
    Herstmonceaux Observatory
    to get a more accurate position of the Prime Meridian.
</p>


<h3>The Poles</h3>
<p>
    The Earth's axis of spin runs through the
    centre of mass.
    We call the points where this axis
    emgerges from the Ellipsoid
    the North and South Poles.
    The position of those objects was measured
    with increasing accuracy from the early
    twentieth century onwards.
    In 1984 the Bureau International d'Heure
    produced what became the
    <a href="https://mycoordinates.org/the-real-definition-of-itrf/">
        International Terrestrial Reference Frame
    </a>,
    which defines everything needed to specify
    a position on the Earth -
    the Poles, the Ellipsoid,
    the Equator etc.
    Because of continental drift
    this is a moving target
    and the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS)
    updates the definition every few years
    to keep it in line with reality.

</p>


<h3>Height</h3>
<p>
    Your angle of longitude,
    angle of latitude
    and height
    identify your position anywhere on the Earth.
    But height above what?
</p>

<p>
    Your <b><i>geoidal height</i></b>
    or <b><i>orthometric height</i></b> is
    your height above or below the Geoid.
</p>


<p>
    Your <b><i>Ellipsoidal Height</i></b> is
    your height above or below the Ellipsoid.
</p>
<p>
    You can also represent your height
    as your height above local mean sea level.
    That will be close to,
    but not always the same as your geoidal height.
</p>

<p>
    In the 1920's the UK Ordnance Survey
    established a measuring station at Newlyn in Cornwall.
    Essentially it's vertical tube,
    partly immersed in the sea,
    with a float sitting on the surface of the water.
    The float goes up and down with the tide.
    Engineers took regular readings of the
    position of the float to establish mean sea level.
    UK maps show the height of a position as an offset
    from this datum.
</p>

<p>
    Here in the UK there's a phenomenon called
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound#:~:text=In%20Great%20Britain%2C%20glaciation%20affected,to%205%20cm%20per%20century).">
        The Post-Glacial Rebound
    </a>.
    During the last ice age,
    ice a few kilometres thick
    covered Scotland, Wales and most of England,
    getting thinner,
    and therefore lighter,
    as it approached the south coast,
    stopping altogether just short of it.
</p>
<p>
    The weight of the ice pushed Scotland downwards
    and in response the southern end of England lifted.
    Since the ice melted
    the land has been bouncing back,
    which causes Scotland to rise from the sea by a couple of millimetres
    each year
    and
    the south of England to sink in response.
    This increases the effect of
    sea level rise in the south of England
    and decreases it in the North of Scotland.
</p>
<p>
    Further north the ice was even thicker
    and the land pushed down even further.
    Parts of northern Europe are rising
    at one centimetre per year.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, sea levels are rising
    across the world due to global warming.
    The effect is bigger in the UK than
    the post-glacial rebound,
    so the overall effect is that
    sea levels are rising everywhere in the UK,
    but they are rising a bit faster
    in the south than in the north.
</p>
<p>
    So UK Mean Sea Level was defined a century ago and
    sea levels have risen steadily since then.
    Strictly, this doesn't matter,
    because UK mean sea level was always just an arbitrary value -
    the mean level of the sea around
    the coast of the UK in places away from Newlyn
    can be different
    due to local currents and other factors.

    <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf/">
        the OS Guide</a>
    discusses this issue.
</p>

<p>
    Different GNSS devices display your height
    using one of ellipsoidal height,
    geoidal height or height above mean sea level.
    Geoidal height and height above mean sea level
    are usually similar but not the same.
    Ellipsoidal height can be very different
    from the other two
    measures at the same position.
</p>



<h3>What time is it?</h3>
<p>
    Our modern notion of time and time zones
    is based on the
    Prime Meridian.
    In days gone by,
    noon was the time of day when the Sun was at its highest
    in the sky,
    which happened at different times
    even just across the UK.
    When the railways came,
    we needed a common notion of the time of day
    so that the operators could publish a timetable.
    That lead to Railway Time,
    which was based on Noon at the Greenwich Observatory.
    Railway Time was later replaced by Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
    and then
    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
</p>
<p>
    As explained
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">here</a>,
    the sun is at its highest point above
    the Prime Meridian at
    different times of day over the year,
    varying over about 16 minutes.
    Noon UTC
    is set to the mean of those times,
    so everybody's notion of
    the time of day depends upon
    the precise position of the Prime Meridian,
    which is now based on the work of IERS.
</p>
<p>
    People follow different timezones around the world
    but they are all based on
    UTC.
    In winter in the UK we use
    the GMT timezone,
    which follows UTC - midnight GMT is midnight UTC.
    In the summer,
    we use British Summer Time (BST),
    which is one hour ahead of UTC.
    Other countries do something similar
    but call it one timezone -
    in France they use
    Central European Time (CET)
    which is one hour ahead of UTC in the winter
    (midnight CET is 1am UTC)
    and two hours ahead in the summer.
</p>





<h3>Terrestrial Reference Frames</h3>
<p>
    A network of observatories
    ("ground stations")
    around the world
    constantly measure the distance
    to each GNSS satellite very accurately.
    The results drive the calculations
    for Precise Point Positioning,
    which is used to correct
    the results of a GNSS survey.
</p>
<p>
    A side effect is that the positions of
    the ground stations are known very accurately.
    These positions are published,
    along with the velocity of the station
    (in other words, the velocity
    of the ground beneath it)
    in metres per year.
</p>
<p>
    Since everything on the Earth's surface
    is moving
    and a position only makes sense
    relative to another position,
    what does it mean to "fix" the Equator
    and Prime Meridian?
</p>
<p>
    One way is to fix them
    at the mean of the movement
    of all of the continental plates.
    That's the basis of the
    International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).
</p>
<p>
    If you
    measure the longitude and latitude of a "fixed" object
    on the ground today within this reference frame,
    then come back and do it again a few years later,
    you will
    get a different answer.
    That line on the ground at
    the Greenwich Observatory
    moves north-east relative to the ITRF
    at about 2.5 centimetres per year.

</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of land surveying,
    this is very inconvenient
    because any position measurements
    that you take gradually become
    out of date.
    If a utility company buries a pipe in the ground
    and wants to come back twenty years later
    to do some maintenance,
    finding where to dig quickly and accurately
    saves money.
    Having to correct the position measurement
    for the passage of time is a nuisance.
</p>
<p>
    Another way to represent your position
    is to tie an entirely notional Equator and Prime Meridian
    to fixed points on the ground on your
    local continental plate.
    Within that reference frame
    your continental plate and everything on it
    stays still and all the other plates
    move.
    Your latitude, longitude
    and height stay the same.

</p>
<p>
    This is essentially what the UK Ordnance Survey
    did when they defined OSGB36.
    Their points on the ground were concrete markers
    called Trig Points that they laid out across the country.
    Nowadays, the GNSS ground stations
    act as the fixed points that define the various reference frames.
</p>
<p>
    The European Terrestrial Reference System
    and the associated European Terrestrial
    Reference Frame
    provide a coordinate system
    which is fixed to points on the ground in Europe.
    There are similar reference frames for other
    regions.
</p>
<p>
    This convention works locally
    but after a few years your notion of the Poles
    and the Equator
    drift away from measurable reality.
    The poles of your reference frame
    no longer match the Earth's
    axis of spin.
<p>
    To stop the various reference
    frames getting too far out of kilter
    with each other and with reality,
    they are reset every few years
    to pull them back to the
    International Terrestrial Reference Frame.
</p>
<p>

    When you record a position using a GNSS receiver,
    you must also record which
    reference frame you used and
    which version of it.
</p>
<p>
    The same point applies to the GNSS satellites.
    The GNSS system depends on published predictions
    of their positions in space within some Earth-based
    reference frame.
    To make sense of the positions,
    you have to know which reference frame is being used
    and,
    if necessary,
    convert the positions to the frame that you are using.
</p>

<h3>Universal Transverse Mercator Coordinates</h3>
<p>
    In the early twentieth century,
    The UK Ordnance Survey
    used longitude and latitude to define positions
    as seen on this
    <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/view/101437072">
        1938 map of Guildford
    </a>.
    If you look at the corners of the map
    and zoom in,
    you'll see that it shows longitude
    along the top and bottom
    and latitude along each side.
</p>
<p>
    In the 1940s
    the OS and some other national mapping authorities adopted
    Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates.
    This approach divides the Ellipsoid into 60 zones,
    each covering about six degrees of longitude.
    The local surface of each zone is projected onto a flat map
    and each position is represented by
    its distance along an east-west line
    (its <b><i>easting</i></b>)
    from a zero point
    and its distance along a north-south line
    (its <b><i>northing</i></b>)
    from the same point.
    More details on UTM are
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system">
        here</a>.

</p>
<p>
    A position in three dimensions can be represented
    by its easting, its northing and its height above
    some base such as mean sea level.
    However,
    making a flat map representing objects
    on a curved surface involves compromises,
    even in a small country like the UK.
</p>
<p>
    During its 1925 to 1962 re-survey of the UK,
    The Ordnance Survey
    created
    the National Grid reference system (OSGB,
    strictly OSGB36),
    also known as British National Grid (BNG).
    More about that
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid">
        here
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    The zero point for OSGB
    eastings and northings is out at sea
    to the south-west of Land's End.
    The notional
    Mean Sea Level was fixed in the 1920's
    using the facility at Newlyn.
</p>
<p>
    OS maps printed since the re-survey
    have shown eastings and northings
    around the edges.
    Contour lines show height above sea level.
</p>

<p>
    OSGB is defined in
    terms of reference points on the ground -
    in the mid twentieth century,
    a network of physical markers
    called Trig Points.
    The most recognisable of these are
    four-foot high concrete pillars built
    at strategic points around the country,
    usually on high ground so that they can be seen from a distance.
    These trig points move with continental drift
    so the OSGB36 grid moves with them.
</p>






<h3>Earth-Centred Earth-Fixed (ECEF or "Cartesian") Coordinates</h3>
<p>
    The GNSS satellites follow
    an elliptical orbit,
    one focus of which is the
    centre of mass of the Earth.
    It's fairly natural to specify
    each satellite's position
    relative to that point.
    ECEF format uses cartesian (x, y, z) coordinates
    measured in metres from that centre.
    So the coordinates are "Earth Centred".
</p>
<p>
    They're "Earth-fixed"
    because the origin of the X, Y and Z axes
    is the centre of the earth.
    and the axes are fixed
    to lines of longitude and latitude.
    The X axis runs from the North Pole to the South Pole,
    the Y axis runs through the centre of the Earth
    and the intersection of the Prime Meridian and the Equator
    (longitude 0, latitude zero).
    The Z axis is perpendicular to the other two.
    (it emerges at latitude zero, longitude 90.)
    For more details of ECEF see
    <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/map/choose-a-3-d-coordinate-system.html">
        here
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    As we've seen,
    the position of the poles and the equator
    depend on which terrestrial reference frame you are using,
    so the same goes for ECEF coordinates.
    You need to know which frame the cartesian axes
    are bound to.
</p>
<p>
    The published positions of the satellites
    that the receiver uses to find its own position
    have to make sense
    everywhere,
    so they
    are specified in the WGS84 reference Frame
    (which is independent of the drifting
    continental plates).
</p>
<p>
    Given that the positions of the satellites are specified
    by ECEF coordinates bound to the WGS84 reference frame,
    the GNSS receiver figures out
    its position within the same reference frame.
    For convenience,
    some receivers converts that result to some other
    coordinate system,
    such as latitude and longitude
    bound to the European Terrestrial Reference Frame
    and height above some suitable geoid.
</p>
<p>
    Latitude, longitude and height is a convenient
    form if you're drawing a map,
    but if you want to work out the distance
    between two positions,
    ECEF is better.
    That's the kind of job that the cartesian coordinate
    system was invented for.
    If two positions close enough together
    that you can ignore the curvature of the Earth,
    you just find the difference in the positions
    along each axis
    and use Pythagoras' Theorem.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately,
    all of my centimetre-accurate GNSS devices
    only display positions as latitude, longitude and height.
</p>

<p>
    Conversion to UTM is more difficult
    than to latitude, longitude and height,
    which is a nuisance here in the UK
    because for the last sixty years
    we've been creating records of positions
    using
    Ordnance Survey grid references.
    Their
    <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation/">
        coordinate transformation web page
    </a>
    converts a position
    from a grid reference
    to all of the other formats
    and back again,
    but it
    introduces a significant error,
    anything up to a metre.
</p>
<p>
    So I have GNSS equipment
    that can find my position within a couple of centimetres,
    but if I use the website to
    convert it to an OS grid reference,
    I lose a lot of that accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    Another of my GNSS devices is a Garmin Etrax,
    a hiking aid.
    It doesn't have a correction system
    so its accuracy can be no more than three metres.
    It displays my position
    using Ordnance Survey notation,
    easting, northing and height above sea level.
    Internally it must be using ECEF format,
    because that's how GNSS works.
    It's then converting the result to OSGB36 for display,
    but I have no idea what algorithm it's using
    or what that the error in the result is.
</p>
<h3>What Three Words</h3>
<p>
    The <a href='https://what3words.com/'>What Three Words</a>
    system divides the world into 3-metre squares
    and gives each square a three-word code.
    For example "pretty.needed.chill"
    represents a point by the river Cherwell
    near Oxford in the UK.
</p>
The 3-meter resolution matches that of a typical unassisted
GNSS receiver.
<p>
    This is a very convenient way to record positions -
    the Surrey
    <a
        href='https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/land-planning-and-development/heritage-and-planning/portable-antiquities-scheme'>
        Portable Antiquities Scheme
    </a>
    recommends its use for reporting finds.
</p>
<p>
    Recording a position at that accuracy
    is better than nothing, but bear in mind
    that the real position is somewhere within
    three metres <i>in all directions</i>,
    so within a six-metre wide circle.
    If an archaeologist wants to come back and search
    that area later,
    they may have to dig a very big hole to find the right spot.
</p>
<p>
    Archaeologists have to dig holes to find things
    but they are painfully aware
    that by doing so
    they are destroying other archaeology
    that could be found in the future
    using techniques not yet invented,
    so they want the hole to be as small as possible.
    Now that they can afford more accurate equipment,
    they are starting to use it.
