<h3>Earth-Centred Earth-Fixed (ECEF or "Cartesian") Coordinates</h3>
<p>
    The GNSS satellites follow
    an elliptical orbit,
    one focus of which is the
    centre of mass of the Earth.
    It's fairly natural to specify
    each satellite's position
    relative to that point.
    ECEF format uses cartesian (x, y, z) coordinates
    measured in metres from that centre.
    So the coordinates are "Earth Centred".
</p>
<p>
    The axes are "Earth-Fixed"
    because they
    run through the centre of the Earth

    and they are fixed
    to the lines of longitude and latitude:

</p>
<p>
    The positive Z axis runs from the centre
    of the Earth and
    through the North Pole
    at latitude 90&deg;.
    The negative Z axis runs through the South Pole at latitude -90&deg;.
</p>
<p>
    The positive X axis runs through
    the intersection of the Prime Meridian and the Equator
    at latitude 0&deg; longitude 0&deg;.
    The negative X axis runs through the
    opposite side of the Earth at latitude 0&deg;, longitude 180&deg;
    (close to the Gilbert Islands in the Pacific Ocean).
</p>
<p>
    The Y axis is perpendicular to the other two.
    The positive Y axis runs through the Equator at latitude 0&deg;
    longitude 90&deg;, close to Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.
    The negative Y axis runs through the Equator at latitude 0&deg;
    longitude -90&deg;, close to the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific.

    For more details of ECEF see

</p>
<p>
    As we've seen,
    the position of the poles, equator
    and Prime Meridian
    depend on which terrestrial reference frame you are using,
    so the same goes for ECEF coordinates.
    <i>When using cartesian coordinates,
        you need to know which terrestrial reference frame the axes are
        bound to.</i>
</p>

<p>
    If two positions are specified in ECEF coordinates
    it's easy to figure out the distance between them.
    A GNSS devices works by measuring
    the distances to satellites and knowing their position,
    so it makes sense to specify
    the positions of the satellites
    in ECEF coordinates.
    The receiver figures out
    its position within the same system.
</p>
<p>

    However, surveyors find latitude, longitude and height
    more useful,
    so all of my survey devices display their position
    in that form.
    The map application on my Apple iPhone does the same.
</p>
<p>
    I also have a Garmin Etrex,
    which is a hiker's SatNav.
    It assumes that you are used to
    UTM coordinates
    (easting, northing and height above sea level)
    and it displays its position in that form.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the scenes,
    all these devices are working in ECEF coordinates
    and converting to some more convenient form
    before displaying the result.
