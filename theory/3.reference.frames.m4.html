<h3>Reference Frames</h3>
<p>
    Continental drift causes the continents to move around
    and change shape slowly.
    In the longer term it builds them up and tears them down.
</p>
<p>
    The UK is part of the Eurasian continent,
    which is moving north-east at about 2.5 centimetres
    per year.
    The line on the ground at Greenwich that marks the
    Prime Meridian is moving with the drift.
</p>
<p>
    That didn't used to matter because
    most surveying equipment
    wasn't accurate enough to notice,
    but now that we have GNSS receivers accurate to
    two or three centimetres,
    it does matter.
    If you measure the position of anything
    fixed to the ground in the UK,
    then come back two years later
    and measure its position again,
    it will have moved by 5 centimetres.
</p>
<p>
    For an organisation like the Ordnance Survey,
    responsible for making maps within one country,
    a convenient way to deal with this is to define
    positions on the ground relative to another
    position on the ground in the same country.
    The real positions will all move due
    to continental drift,
    but the maps will still be consistent
    within themselves.
    That leads to the idea of a <b><i>reference frame</i></b>.
    essentially a version of latitude and longitude
    with a Prime Meridian
    fixed in some agreed way,
    for example, fixed to objects on the ground.
</p>


<h4>WGS84</h4>
<p>
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System'>
        The World Geodetic system 1984
    </a> (WGS84) is fixed to the mean movement of the continents,
    so each continent moves against it constantly.
    In a world where the axis of spin,
    the magnetic field and everything on the land and
    on the sea bed is moving around,
    WGS84 is the nearest thing we have to a notion of
    where things really are.
</p>
<p>
    My Trimble Catalyst GNSS receiver
    figures out its position in the WGS84
    reference frame
    but I can set it to convert the results to
    ETRF89 or one of a range of other
    reference frames suitable for individual countries.
</p>


<h4>ITRF</h4>
<p>
    The <a href="https://itrf.ign.fr/en/solutions/itrf2020">
        International Terrestrial Reference Frame
    </a>
    is a close friend of WGS84
    but calculated in a different way.
    The current version is
    ITRF2020.
    A quick Google search produces references like
    <a
        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=itrf20+versu+wgs84&oq=itrf20+versu+wgs84&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIKCAMQABiABBiiBNIBCDc3NTFqMGo5qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">
        this
    </a>,
    explaining that positions in ITRF2020 and WGS84 are almost the same.
</p>
<p>
    As explained later,
    I use the Canadian Government's Precise Point Positioning
    service to figure out the position of my base station
    and it produces results within the ITRF framework.
    They recently switched from an older version to ITRF2020.
</p>

<h4>ETRF89</h4>
<p>
    Within Europe
    it makes sense to use the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Terrestrial_Reference_System_1989">
        European Terrestrial Reference Frame
    </a>
    (ETRF89).
    This is fixed to GNSS ground stations in Europe and Asia
    and drifts with them.
    It's convenient for cartography in Europe
    because if you measure a position in this reference frame
    and come back a few years later to measure it again,
    it will not appear to have moved.
</p>
<p>
    At the start of 1989, ETRF89 was set to coincide with ITRF,
    but
    continental drift constantly pulls the two apart.
    By the year 2000 they disagreed by 25 centimetres.
    To prevent ETRF89 getting too far removed from reality
    it has to be refactored every few years,
    producing different versions.
    The version ETRF2000
    coincided with ITRF at the start of 2000.
    Since then there's been more drift
    and the current version ETRF2020
    coincides with ITRF as it was at the start of 2020.
</p>
<p>
    This means that when you record a position using ETRF89
    you have to note which version of the framework you used.
    If you use ETRF2020 and come back thirty years later
    to find the same spot,
    you will either have to use ETRF2020 again
    or use whatever the latest version is,
    and correct the result.
    Getting that wrong could at least lead to you
    wasting money digging a hole in the wrong place.
    If you're trying to resolve a boundary dispute,
    a little detail like that could land you in serious trouble.
</p>
<p>
    Other reference frames are defined
    that work well for cartography
    in particular parts of Europe.
