<h2>Geographical Coordinate Systems</h2>
<p>
    GNSS systems report positions using all sorts of conventions,
    so we have to look at the different ways that a position
    can be represented.
</p>
<p>
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf'>
        This guide
    </a>
    from the UK's mapping authority
    The Ordnance Survey (OS)
    gives an excellent introduction.
</p>
<p>
    The OS also provides
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation/'>
        this web page
    </a>
    which converts a position
    expressed in one coordinate system
    into all the others.
    (Beware: the accuracy is limited!)
</p>
<p>
    For use offline, the OS offers
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/projection-and-transformation-calculations.xls'>
        this spreadsheet tool
    </a>
    which does similar conversions,
    (maybe more accurately,
    I haven't checked yet).
</p>
<p>
    What follows is my take on the subject.
</p>
<h3>The Shape of the Earth</h3>
<p>
    According to
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis#:~:text=Astronomers%20think%20the%20collision%20between,Earth%20was%20nearly%20fully%20formed">
        current theories
    </a>
    the Earth and the Moon were
    formed about 4.5 billion years ago
    when two planets collided.
    The heat generated by the impact
    caused the two bodies to melt
    and then merge.
    Some of the material was ejected and coalesced to form the Moon.
</p>
<p>
    The resulting Earth has a solid core at the centre,
    mainly iron,
    very hot but under huge pressure,
    which stops it from melting.
    Above that is more iron,
    under less pressure and liquid.
    It's the rotation of that
    which generates the Earth's magnetic field.
    Further out from the centre is the mantle,
    essentially a hot gooey mess of rock,
    flowing like a very viscous liquid.
    The solid surface crust floats on top of the mantle.
</p>
<p>
    The material in one of the original two planets was
    a little denser than
    the material in the other and there are still huge lumps
    of this denser material slowly moving around,
    deep below the surface.
</p>
<p>
    As a result the centre of gravity of the Earth
    is not at the same position as the geometric centre
    and both move around.
    The axis of spin passes through the centre of gravity,
    causing the poles to move with it.
</p>

<p>
    The crust is broken into large plates
    which move around slowly,
    pushed and pulled by convection currents in the mantle.
</p>
<p>
    On the surface,
    the tides move huge volumes of water
    backwards and forwards during the day.
    Even a nearby mountain can have enough material
    in it to deflect local gravity slightly.
    These and other factors
    cause local gravity to be uneven
    so that it doesn't always pull directly towards the centre of mass
    of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
    To sum up, nothing
    on the Earth is fixed.
    There's no solid ground.
    There's a thin shell,
    relatively solid,
    around a huge boiling maelstrom of
    molten fluid.
    Convection currents deep inside stir up the material,
    causing the centre of gravity, the axis of spin, the magnetic poles and the
    continents on the surface to move around.
</p>
<h3>The Rate of Continental Drift</h3>

<p>
    The Earth's crust is composed of <b><i>tectonic plates</i></b>
    which move around the surface
    and change shape slowly
    due to
    <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/continental-drift/">
        continental drift
    </a>.
    The plates move at different rates
    and in different directions.
    The part of the European plate
    that I live on moves
    at about 2.5 cm per year
    heading approximately north-east.
    The USA moves in a different direction
    and the two plates move apart at about 3cm per year.
    Iceland sits at the point where the two plates part
    which causes all sorts of geophysical effects,
    some quite violent.
</p>
<p>
    This slow movement didn't used to matter so much
    to surveyors
    because their equipment was not sensitive enough
    to notice it.
    Now it can be detected
    using equipment costing only a few hundred dollars
    and so it has to be taken into account.
</p>

<h3>The Ellipsoid</h3>
<p>
    The Earth is held together by its own gravity and is almost,
    but not quite, a sphere.
    It spins on an axis,
    which stretches it very slightly at the Equator and
    shrinks it very slightly at the poles,
    making it approximately an ellipsoid.
</p>
<p>
    As explained
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Marie_de_La_Condamine'>
        here
    </a>
    this was predicted by Newton's Theory of Gravity and
    established in the 1730's by two French surveying expeditions,
    one to Lapland and one to Ecuador.
    They each measured the distance covered on land of one degree of latitude
    and showed that
    the result in Lapland,
    close to the North Pole, was not the same as the result
    in Ecuador,
    close to the Equator.
    <a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0074t5l/voyages-of-discovery-the-figure-of-the-earth'>
        This BBC programme
    </a>
    describes the expedition to Ecuador.
</p>
<p>
    Newton's theory assumed that the density of the Earth was
    uniform
    so it predicted that the Equator is circular,
    meaning that the Earth is a <b><i>Spheroid</i></b>.
    According to
    <a href="https://www.icsm.gov.au/education/fundamentals-mapping/datums#ellipsoid">
        this page
    </a>

    "A Spheroid is simply a type of Ellipsoid which is as wide as it is long
    (i.e. circular around the middle and close in shape to that of a sphere).
    All other Ellipsoids are longer than they are wide
    (i.e. have an oval shape between ends and in the middle, like a football)."
</p>
<p>
    In 1830,
    the British Astronomer Royal
    George Airy defined the <b><i>Airy Spheroid</i></b>
    which was a good approximation to
    the shape of the Earth,
    given the data available at the time.
    In 1936
    the UK Ordnance Survey
    defined the OSGB36 coordinate system
    based on Airy's spheroid.
    They still use OSGB36 for their paper maps.
    More on that
    <a href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/ostn15-new-geoid-britain'>
        here
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    As surveying techniques improved
    it became clear that the Equator is not quite
    a circle so a spheroid is not a good enough
    fit.
    Geographers now use a more general ellipsoid
    that's close on average to the Earth's real shape.
    It's called <b><i>the Ellipsoid</i></b>
    (capital E).
</p>
<p>
    The Ellipsoid is not always a convenient tool
    for making maps,
    and some cartographers
    define other ellipsoids
    that better approximate the shape of
    the locality that they are interested in.
</p>
<p>
    Just to confuse the matter even more,
    the term "spheroid" is also sometimes used
    interchangeably with
    "ellipsoid"
    in cartography,
    even though one is a special case of
    the other.
</p>
<p>

        here
    </a>.
</p>

<h3>The Geoid</h3>
<p>
    As already mentioned,
    gravity doesn't always point at the centre of mass of the Earth.
    There's another solid shape called <b><i>The Geoid</i></b>
    (which just means "Earth-shaped" in Latin).
</p>


<p>
    According to Wikipedia:
    "The
    Geoid is the shape that the ocean surface
    would take under the influence of the gravity of Earth, including
    gravitational attraction and Earth's rotation,
    if other influences such as winds and tides were absent.
    This surface
    is extended through the continents."
</p>

<p>
    You can find more about The Geoid
    <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-geoid-why-do-we-use-it-and-where-does-its-shape-come">
        here
    </a>.

</p>

<p>
    The Geoid is approximately
    at mean sea level
    at the points where
    the land meets the sea,
    so it's a good replacement
    for the rather vague concept of
    mean sea level.
</p>
<p>
    As with ellipsoids,
    mapmakers often define their own geoids
    which more closely match their local conditions.
</p>
<p>
    To sum up,
    ellipsoids (sometimes called spheroids)
    are <i>regular</i> solids that approximate to the shape of the Earth
    and geoids are <i>irregular</i> solids that also approximate to the shape of the Earth.
    The Ellipsoid and the Geoid
    (with capitals) are designed to work globally
    but local ellipsoids and geoids can
    approximate the local landscape more
    conveniently for local maps.
