<h3>Universal Transverse Mercator Coordinates</h3>
<p>
    In the early twentieth century,
    The UK Ordnance Survey
    used longitude and latitude to define positions
    as seen on this
    <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/view/101437072">
        1938 map of Guildford
    </a>.
    If you look at the corners of the map
    and zoom in,
    you'll see that it shows longitude
    along the top and bottom
    and latitude along each side.
</p>
<p>
    In the 1940s
    the OS and some other national mapping authorities adopted
    Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates.
    This approach divides the Ellipsoid into 60 zones,
    each covering six degrees of longitude.
    The local surface of each zone is projected onto a flat map
    and each position on the surface of the Ellipsoid
    is represented by
    its distance along an east-west line
    (its <b><i>easting</i></b>)
    from a zero point
    and its distance along a north-south line
    (its <b><i>northing</i></b>)
    from the same point.
    More details on UTM are
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system">
        here</a>.

</p>
<p>
    A position in three dimensions can be represented
    by its easting, northing and its height above
    some base, such as local mean sea level.
</p>
<p>
    During its 1925 to 1962 re-survey of the UK,
    The Ordnance Survey
    created
    the National Grid reference system (OSGB,
    strictly OSGB36),
    also known as British National Grid (BNG).
    It's based on the Airy Spheroid,
    produced in the 19th Century.
    More about OSGB36
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid">
        here
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    The zero point for OSGB
    eastings and northings is out at sea
    to the south-west of Land's End
    at latitude 49.7668065515&deg; longitude -7.5572420349&deg;.
</p>
<p>
    The notional
    Mean Sea Level was fixed in the 1920's
    using the facility at Newlyn.
    It's about 55 metres above the Ellipsoid.
</p>
<p>
    OS maps printed since the re-survey
    have shown eastings and northings
    around the edges.
    Contour lines show height above sea level.
</p>
<p>
    By the time of the survey
    the UK scientific community has adopted
    International Systems (metric) units,
    but the rest of the country
    still used the old Imperial units -
    inches, feet and miles.
    The OS teams did their measurements in metres
    but continued to draw their maps in Imperial units,
    using scales such as
    six inches to the mile.
    When the UK went metric in 1971,
    they rescaled the maps to metric units.
</p>

<p>
    OSGB is defined in
    terms of reference points on the ground
    laid out during the survey.
    The OS produced
    a network of physical markers
    called Trig Points.
    The most recognisable of these are
    four-foot high concrete pillars built
    at strategic points around the country,
    usually on high ground so that they can be seen from a distance.
    These trig points move with continental drift
    so the OSGB36 grid moves with them.
</p>

<p>
    Modern survey equipment is accurate enough to
    reveal flaws in the Airy Spheroid,
    making conversion from GPS coordinates
    to OSGB36 difficult and error-prone.
</p>
<p>
    The UK Ordnance Survey provide
    <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation/">
        this web page
    </a>
    which converts between the various formats.
    It can take a position expressed as
    latitude, longitude and height above the Ellipsoid
    in the ETRF89 reference frame
    and convert it to ECEF coordinates and OSGB36
    easting, northings and height above mean sea level,
    but it seems to introduce a significant error.
    That's a nuisance
    because here in the UK
    we've been creating records of positions
    using
    OSGB36
    for the last sixty years
</p>
<p>
    So I have GNSS equipment
    that can find my position within a couple of centimetres,
    but if I use that OS web page to
    convert it to an OS grid reference,
    I lose a lot of that accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    The OS also provide a
    <a
        href='https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/projection-and-transformation-calculations.xls'>spreadsheet</a>
    that you can download and run on your own computer
    to convert coordinates from one form to another.
    I don't know if that's any better.
