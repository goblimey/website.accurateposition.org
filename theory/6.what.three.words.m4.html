<h3>What Three Words</h3>
<p>
    The <a href='https://what3words.com/'>What Three Words</a>
    system divides the world into 3-metre squares
    and gives each square a three-word code.
    For example "pretty.needed.chill"
    represents a point by the river Cherwell
    near Oxford in the UK.
</p>
The 3-meter resolution matches that of a typical unassisted
GNSS receiver.
<p>
    This is a very convenient way to record positions -
    the Surrey

        Portable Antiquities Scheme
    </a>
    recommends its use for reporting finds.
</p>
<p>
    Recording a position at that accuracy
    is better than nothing, but bear in mind
    that the real position is somewhere within
    three metres <i>in all directions</i>,
    so within a six-metre wide circle.
    If an archaeologist wants to come back and search
    that area later,
    they may have to dig a very big hole to find the right spot.
</p>
<p>
    Archaeologists have to dig holes to find things
    but they are painfully aware
    that by doing so
    they are destroying other archaeology
    that could be found in the future
    using techniques not yet invented,
    so they want the hole to be as small as possible.
    Now that they can afford more accurate equipment,
    they are starting to use it.
