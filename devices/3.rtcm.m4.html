<h2>RTCM</h2>


<p>
    The Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM)
    produced a standard protocol for sending satellite
    observation data over a data link.
    The protocol is also called RTCM.
    It allows a base station from one manufacturer to
    send signal data to a rover from
    another manufacturer.
    The RTCM protocol is currently at version 3.
</p>
<p>
    RTCM3 messages are in a compact binary form and not readable by eye.
    The format is described by RTCM STANDARD 10403.3 Differential GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) Services –
    Version 3 (RTCM3 10403.3).
    This is not an open source standard.
    It costs about $300 to buy a copy.
    You don't need to do that to use the equipment.
</p>
<p>
    It's worth saying that I'm a software engineer,
    not a Geodesy expert.
    My role is to understand
    the format of the messages
    and write software to display them
    in a form that an ordinary human can understand.
    As you will see,
    there are gaps in my understanding
    of what all this stuff actually means.
</p>
<p>
    Version 3 of RTCM tidied things up
    by introducing Multiple Signal Messages (MSMs).
    These make a large number of other messages obsolescent -
    they are still there but no longer needed.
    It's now possible to run a base station and rover
    setup using just
    six or seven types of message.
</p>
<p>
    Multiple Signal Messages carry
    the base station's observations
    of signals to the rover.
    There are various types,
    all following a common format.
    For accurate GNSS you need an MSM type 4 message
    for each constellation that you are interested in
    or the equivalent MSM type 7 messages.
</p>
<p>
    If everything is working smoothly
    you shouldn't have to worry too much about
    the workings of RTCM,
    but things sometimes go wrong,
    and being able to see
    what's going on under the covers
    can be a great help.
</p>
<p>
    I've written software that decodes some of the RTCM messages
    and displays them.
    In particular,
    my RTCM Proxy
    can sit between your base station and your caster
    and display the messages that
    recently passed between them.
</p>



<p>
    The various GNSS satellites send out a stream of signals once per second.
    An RTCM base station scans
    all the signals that it's interested in and
    creates one MSM for each constellation.
    The MSM
    contains data about each signal
    that the base received
    from satellites in that constellation.
    The base also sends out
    type 1005 or 1006 messages
    giving its position.
</p>
<p>
    If the base station has a LoRa radio,
    it broadcasts those messages
    and any rover in range
    with a LoRa radio can pick them up.
</p>
<p>
    If the base station has an Internet connection
    it can packages up the messages
    into NTRIP format and stream them
    to a caster endpoint.
    A rover with an Internet connection
    can subscribe to the same endpoint
    and receive the stream of messages.
    This medium can be more reliable
    than radio and you can pick up signals
    from base stations that are out of radio range.
</p>
<p>
    There is still another range limit.
    For the messages to be useful,
    the rover needs to
    receive signals from some of the same satellites,
    so the messages from a base station
    become progressively less useful
    as the rover gets further away.
</p>
My software decodes these Multiple Signal Message types:
<ul>
    <li>1074 type 4 (low resolution) observations of signals from GPS satellites</li>
    <li>1077 type 7 (high resolution) observations of signals from GPS satellites</li>
    <li>1084 type 4 for GLONASS</li>
    <li>1087 type 7 for GLONASS</li>
    <li>1094 type 4 for Galileo</li>
    <li>1097 type 7 for Galileo</li>
    <li>1124 type 4 for Beidou</li>
    <li>1127 type 7 for Beidou</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    MSM type 7 messages include the same fields as their MSM4 equivalents but to higher resolution,
    and they have some extra fields,
    so they take up a little more network bandwidth.
    Both types are sufficient for centimetre accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    A base station should be configured to send out either MSM4 or MSM7 messages.
    Sending both just wastes bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
    U-Blox advises that if a rover based on their technology uses
    GLONASS MSMs (message type 1084 or 1087),
    the base
    station should also send messages of
    type 1230 GLONASS Code-Phase Bias Values.
    Unfortunately I haven't managed to
    reverse-engineer those,
    so I have no idea
    what they contain
    or what they are for.
</p>
<p>
    A rover also needs type 1005 or 1006 messages,
    which give the position of the base station.
    Type 1005 gives just the position,
    type 1006 gives the position of a point
    on the ground and
    the height of the base station above that point.
    That's useful if your base station is on a tripod
    somewhere above a point that you've
    measured very accurately.)
</p>
<p>
    The UBlox ZED-F9P Integration Manual (2022-02 edition)
    section 3.1.5.5.3 'Base station: RTCM output conﬁguration'
    recommends that the base station sends these messages:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>RTCM 1005 Stationary RTK reference station ARP (or type 1006)</li>
    <li>RTCM 1074 GPS MSM4</li>
    <li>RTCM 1084 GLONASS MSM4</li>
    <li>RTCM 1094 Galileo MSM4</li>
    <li>RTCM 1124 BeiDou MSM4</li>
    <li>RTCM 1230 GLONASS code-phase biases</li>
</ul>
MSM7 messages can be used instead of MSM4 -
message types 1077, 1087, 1097 and 1127.
So a working base station might be configured
to send out messages of type 1005, 1074, 1084, 1094, 1124 and 1230.
Alternatively
it could use high resolution MSMs,
so message types 1005, 1077, 1087, 1097, 1127 and 1230.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally the base should send
    out the MSMs once per second,
    the same rate that it and the rover are
    receiving the signals that the MSMs describe.
</p>
<p>
    Position messages (type 1005 or 1006)
    can be sent out less often.
    For a
    particular base those messages will always contain the same position
    so a rover only needs to receive one of them at
    the start of a session to work properly.
    The advice is to send one every ten seconds,
    so when a rover subscribes to
    a caster endpoint it will get
    all the messages it needs within a few seconds.
    It takes a while for it to download the
    satellite ephemerides,
    so a short wait for the
    base position message is OK.
</p>
<p>
    The U-Blox Integration Manual also mentions two U-Blox proprietary message types:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
4072.0 Reference station PVT and
4072.1 Additional reference station information,
</pre>
U-Blox don't publish the format
so I can't decode these Messages.
Fortunately I can ignore them both.
Type 4072.1 is only used by old U-Blox firmware
and mine is up to date.
Apparently type 4072.0 is used to give
the position of
a moving base station.
I only use
fixed base stations so
that message type is irrelevant too.
</p>


<h3>RTCM Format</h3>
<p>
    This section is mainly of interest to programmers
    who want to understand how to decipher RTCM messages.
</p>
<p>
    There are already open-source tools available to convert an
    RTCM3 data stream into another format called RINEX.
    That's an open standard and the result is human readable.
</p>

<p>
    There is a little bit of useful information scattered around various public web pages.
    There's also
    <a href='https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB'>RTKLIB</a>,
    a set of open source tools written in C
    such as an RTCM to RINEX converter.
    The core library was my main source of information
    when I reverse-engineered the messages.
    In my software repository
    I've copied some of the more relevant RTKLIB source files
    as a handy reference for other programmers.
</p>

<p>
    The RTKLIB source code has functionality to decode most RTCM messages.
    If you need to understand message types that I don't decode,
    look there.
    However, that code can be difficult to follow and comments are scant.
</p>
<p>
    My software is written in Go,
    which has all sorts of useful features
    that C doesn't offer.
    I didn't just convert the RTKLIB source code
    from C to Go. That would have introduced
    errors.
    I wrote everything from scratch.
    For final testing
    I captured some messages that my device produced and
    used the RTKLIB tool to convert them into RINEX format.
    That gave me a (relatively) readable version of the
    data from an independent source.
    I then wrote integration tests to check that my software
    produced the same numbers from the same data.
    I also wrote lots of unit tests that worked from first principles to
    test the fine logic.
</p>
<p>
    My Go source code is in two parts,
    a core that ingests a stream of RTCM messages
    and displays them,
    and some simple drivers that
    set up the core and feed
    data into it.
    The test in the core
    cover 100% of the source code.
</p>
<p>
    An RTCM3 message is
    a stream of bits in a frame.
    Different message types are different lengths
    and some are variable length.
</p>
<p>
    Each message frame is composed of a three-byte header, an embedded
    message and 3 bytes of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) data.
    The header starts with a 0xd3 byte and includes the
    length of the embedded message.
    Each embedded message starts with a 12-bit message number which defines the type.
    Apart from that message number, each type of message is in a different format.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid confusion between the complete RTCM message
    (header, embedded message and trailing CRC) and the embedded
    message, I talk about message frames and embedded messages.
    If I just talk about a message,
    I mean an embedded message.
</p>
<p>
    Fields within the messages that I'm interested in
    are either unsigned integers or signed integers.
    Signed integers are in two's-complement format.
</p>
<p>
    My software uses two functions to extract the data
    from the message frames.
    The getbitu() function reads a given set of bits from the bit stream,
    interprets them as an unsigned integer of that
    size and returns the value.

    The getbits() function is similar but it
    interprets the bit field
    as a signed integer.
</p>
<p>
    This is a hex dump of a complete RTCM3 message frame and the start of another:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    d3 00 aa 44 90 00 33 f6 ea e2 00 00 0c 50 00 10
    08 00 00 00 20 01 00 00 3f aa aa b2 42 8a ea 68
    00 00 07 65 ce 68 1b b4 c8 83 7c e6 11 30 10 3f
    05 ff 4f fc e0 4f 61 68 59 b6 86 b5 1b a1 31 b9
    d9 71 55 57 07 a0 00 d3 2e 0c 99 01 98 c4 fa 16
    0e fa 6e ac 07 19 7a 07 3a a4 fc 53 c4 fb ff 97
    00 4c 6f f8 65 da 4e 61 e4 75 2c 4b 01 e5 21 0d
    4f c0 0b 02 b0 b0 2f 0c 02 70 94 23 0b c3 e9 e0
    97 d1 70 63 00 45 8d e9 71 d7 e5 eb 5f f8 78 00
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 4d f5 5a
    d3 00 6d 46 40 00 33 f6 10 22 00 00 02 40 08 16
</pre>
The first message starts at byte zero.
That byte has the value 0xd3 (hexadecimal d3),
which announces the
start of a message frame.
The frame is composed of a 3-byte header, an embedded message and 3 bytes of Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC) data.
</p>
<p>
    Byte 0 of an RTCM message frame is always d3.
    The top few bits of byte 1 are always zero.
    The lower two bits and the bits of byte 2
    form the 10-bit unsigned message length value,
    in the example, hex 0aa, decimal
    176.
    So the embedded message is 176 bytes long.
    With the header and CRC the whole message frame is 182 bytes long.
    The frame takes up all but
    the last line of the example.
    The last line starts with a d3 byte which
    is the start of the next message.
</p>
<p>
    The first twelve bits of the embedded message are the message type.
</p>
<p>
    The bit string in the embedded message
    may end with some zero padding bits to complete the last byte and that can be
    followed by a few zero padding bytes,
    as in the first message in the example.
</p>
<p>
    Messages can be transmitted over a radio link
    or a serial line
    and both of those media are prone to corruption.
    The last three bytes of the frame (in this case 4d, f5 and 5a) are the CRC value. To check the CRC, take the header
    and the embedded message,
    run the CRC calculation over those bytes and compare the result with the given CRC.
    If they are the same, your bit stream is almost certainly
    an uncorrupted RTCM3 message frame.
    If
    they are different then
    your bit stream is not complete,
    or it's not an RTCM3 message frame,
    or it's been corrupted in transit.
    Discard it.
</p>
<p>
    The CRC check is calculated using an algorithm from Qualcomm.
    My software uses Mark Rafter's Go implementation, also in my
    github account at https://github.com/goblimey/go-crc24q.
</p>
<p>
    The first 12 bits of the embedded message give the message number,
    in the example hex 449, decimal 1097, which is a
    type 7 Multiple Signal Message (MSM7)
    containing high resolution observations of signals from Galileo satellites.
</p>
<p>
    A d3 byte marks the start of each message
    but the embedded message is binary and can also contain some d3 values.
    Note the one on the fifth line of the hex dump.
    That's not the start of another message.
    One clue is that it's not followed by a few
    zero bits.
</p>
<p>
    To extract a message frame from a stream of data and decode it,
    you need to read the header and the next
    two bytes, check the header,
    find the message length,
    read the whole message frame and check the CRC value.
    This
    matters particularly when you start to receive a stream of data from a device.
    You may come into the data stream
    part-way through and blunder into a d3 byte
    that isn't the start of a message.
</p>

<p>
    RTCM3 message frames in the NTRIP data stream are contiguous,
    with no separators or newlines.
    The last line of the
    example contains the start of the next message.
    Data in other formats (such as NMEA messages) may be interspersed between
    frames.
</p>
<p>
    The data stream is not necessarily all RTCM3 messages.
    It may contain messages in other formats such as NMEA.
    My RTCM filter cleans up a source data stream
    and allows through only correct RTCM3 messages.
</p>
<p>
    Each satellite in a constellation is numbered.
    The standard allows 64 satellites numbered 1-64 in each
    constellation.
    There aren't actually that many satellites in orbit -
    the GPS system has 31, for example.
    The standard also allows for
    32 types of signal sent within various frequency bands.
</p>
<p>
    At any point on the Earth only some
    satellites will be visible.
    Signals from some of those may be too weak to register,
    so the resulting message may
    contain readings of just some signals from just some satellites
    and some of the signals may be incomplete.
    My base stations are dual
    band and receive up to
    two signals from each satellite.
    In each scan
    they typically see signals
    from upwards of twenty satellites.
</p>
<h4>Message Type 1005 - Stationary RTK Reference Station ARP</h4>
<p>

    See decode_type1005() in rtcm3.c at line 375.
</p>
<p>
    That function defines an object of type sta_t, defined in rtklib.h at line 833:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    typedef struct { /* station parameter type */
    char name [MAXANT]; /* marker name */
    char marker [MAXANT]; /* marker number */
    char antdes [MAXANT]; /* antenna descriptor */
    char antsno [MAXANT]; /* antenna serial number */
    char rectype[MAXANT]; /* receiver type descriptor */
    char recver [MAXANT]; /* receiver firmware version */
    char recsno [MAXANT]; /* receiver serial number */
    int antsetup; /* antenna setup id */
    int itrf; /* ITRF realization year */
    int deltype; /* antenna delta type (0:enu,1:xyz) */
    double pos[3]; /* station position (ecef) (m) */
    double del[3]; /* antenna position delta (e/n/u or x/y/z) (m) */
    double hgt; /* antenna height (m) */
    } sta_t;
</pre>
So amongst other things,
the message contains the antenna position expressed in ECEF format
(cartesian coordinates
relative to the centre of the Earth).
</p>
<p>
    Reading the function tells me that
    the format of the message is:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>message type - 12 bit unsigned integer</li>
    <li>Station ID - 12 bit unsigned integer</li>
    <li>ITRF realisation year- 6 bit unsigned integer</li>
    <li>? - 4 bits</li>
    <li>ECEF X position - 38 bit signed integer to be converted to floating point</li>
    <li>? - 2 bits</li>
    <li>ECEF Y position - 38 bit signed integer to be converted to floating point</li>
    <li>? - 2 bits</li>
    <li>ECEF Z position - 38 bit signed integer to be converted to floating point</li>
</ul>

(The RTKLIB software ignores the fields
I've marked by "?"
so I don't know what's in them.
If you need to know, you may have to buy a
copy of the standard.)
</p>
<p>
    The 38 bit values are the distance from the centre of the Earth
    along each cartesian axis (positive or negative) in tenth
    millimeters.
    To convert to meters, divide by 0.0001.
</p>
<p>
    That granularity is much smaller than the
    accuracy that my equipment provides,
    maybe more than any equipment provides.
    I guess that the RTCM standard uses deliberate overkill
    to avoid having to be redefined as better equipment
    emerges.
</p>
<h4>Multiple Signal Messages (MSMs)</h4>
<p>
    Multiple Signal Messages (MSMs) contain the data
    from the signals received (observed) from the satellites.
    Each
    message describes the signals observed from
    the satellites in a particular constellation.
    My equipment is configured to receive signals from
    GPS,
    Galileo, Glonass and Beidou satellites
    and send four MSMs per second,
    one for each of those constellations.
</p>

<p>
    Distance information (range) in an MSM message is giving as the transit time from the satellite to the base station
    in
    milliseconds.
    To convert this into a distance in metres, multiply by the speed of light per millisecond.
</p>
<p>
    Some values in the MSM
    are represented by an approximate value
    in one part of the message and a delta value in
    another part, both scaled integers.
    The delta is signed.
    To turn this into a single value,
    I adjust the scales and add the delta to the
    approximate value.
    For display purposes,
    I take the resulting scaled integer and convert
    it to a float value of the appropriate size.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the ranges (the distance from the satellite to the receiver)
    are given in three parts,
    making up the transit time in
    milliseconds.
    The satellite cells (see later)
    contains an approximate range given
    as whole milliseconds and
    fractional milliseconds,
    then each signal cell (also see later)
    contain a delta.
    My software displays the resulting ranges in metres.
</p>
<p>
    Dividing values up this way
    makes sense because it saves space in the message.
    The apparent distance
    given by the transit times
    of signals from the same satellite
    may be different,
    because the signals have travelled along
    different paths,
    but they won't be very different.
    Sending one value and some small deltas
    avoids having to send two long bit strings
    with only a few bits different.
</p>
<h4>Invalid Values</h4>
<p>
    Some fields have a special value indicating that the
    it's invalid and should be ignored -
    maybe reception was a bit poor
    and only some parts of the signal got through.
    With one exception,
    the invalid value for each field
    in the bit stream has its
    top bit set to a one
    and the rest of the digits set to zero.
    Once the bits of the field have
    been read and converted,
    the meaning depends on the data type.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the invalid value for a 22-bit field is
    100000000000000000.
    Signed integers are two's complement values,
    so if the field represents a signed integer,
    its value is a negative number,
    decimal -2097152.
    On the other hand,
    if a field represents an unsigned integer,
    the same bit pattern would be interpreted
    as a large positive number.
</p>
<p>
    The various invalid values used are:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
8 bits unsigned: 255
14 bits signed: -8192
15 bits signed: -16384
20 bits signed: -524288
22 bits signed: -2097152
24 bits signed: -8388608
</pre>
255 is the exception to the "top bit one,
other bits zero" convention.
That number has all eight bits set to 1.
<h3>The MSM Header</h3>
<p>
    An MSM message can contain many signals from many satellites,
    all in the same constellation.
    Most of the fields are fixed length,
    but one is variable length,
    so the whole header is variable length.
</p>

<p>

    In the RTKLIB code, line of rtcm3.c defines a type msm_h_t with
    some useful comments on the right-hand side:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    typedef struct { /* multi-signal-message header type */
    unsigned char iod; /* issue of data station */
    unsigned char time_s; /* cumulative session transmitting time */
    unsigned char clk_str; /* clock steering indicator */
    unsigned char clk_ext; /* external clock indicator */
    unsigned char smooth; /* divergence free smoothing indicator */
    unsigned char tint_s; /* smoothing interval */
    unsigned char nsat,nsig; /* number of satellites/signals */
    unsigned char sats[64]; /* satellites */
    unsigned char sigs[32]; /* signals */
    unsigned char cellmask[64]; /* cell mask */
    } msm_h_t;
</pre>
Line 1745 of rtcm3.c defines a function decode_msm_head
which reads the bitstream and creates an msm_h_t object.

<p>
    The format of the bitstream is:

    <li>station ID - 12 bit unsigned integer</li>
    <li>timestamp - 30 bit unsigned integer</li>

    <li>signal mask - 32 bit unsigned integer, one bit for each signal type observed
    <li>cell mask - nSatellitesXnSignals bits(variable length but &lt;= 64) </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Timestamps and Rollover</h4>
<p>
    Each Multiple Signal Message contains a timestamp,
    milliseconds since some start point.
    The handler converts this to a date and time for display
    so the handler needs to know when the messages were collected.
</p>
<p>
    (Blewitt's paper explains that the signals from the satellites
    contain a timestamp.
    My guess is that the timestamps in the MSMs are just copies
    of the timestamps in those signals.)
</p>
<p>
    Except for GLONASS messages the timestamp is a single integer value,
    milliseconds from the
    constellation's start of week.
    GLONASS uses a two-part timestamp containing an integer day of the week
    and an integer
    millisecond offset from the start of day.
    The handler displays all these timestamps as times in UTC, so
    given a stream of observations advancing in time,
    it needs to know in which week the first one was taken.
</p>
<p>
    When you create a handler you specify a date,
    or if you need to be more precise, a date, time and time zone.
    If you are processing messages streaming from a live GNSS device
    you can use the date and time now
    as long as your computer's system clock is set correctly.
    You can use the Network Time Service (NTP) to ensure that.
    If you're processing old messages,
    you can specify any time during the week that they
    were sent.
    The handler works out everything it needs from that.
</p>
<p>
    The timestamps for different constellations roll over at different times.
</p>
<p>
    The GLONASS timestamp rolls over
    to day zero, millisecond zero at midnight at the start of Sunday
    in the Moscow timezone, which is 21:00 on
    Saturday in UTC.
    If the handler is processing a stream of messages which started at 20:45
    on a Saturday
    in UTC, the GLONASS timestamp values will be quite large at first.
    At 21:00 the week rolls over and the timestamps
    will start again at (zero, zero).
</p>
<p>
    The timestamps in MSMs carrying observations of
    signals from GPS satellites
    roll over to zero a few seconds after midnight UTC at the start of Sunday.
    So at 20:45 UTC the GPS timestamps will also be large and they will roll over to
    zero about three hours later than the Glonass ones,
    a few seconds after the next midnight UTC.
</p>
<p>
    Galileo timestamps follow the same scheme as GPS.
</p>
<p>
    The timestamps in MSMs carrying observations from
    Beidou satellites roll over 4 seconds after midnight UTC.
</p>

<p>
    The handler can keep track of this as long as
    (a) it knows the time of the first observation,
    and (b) there
    are no large gaps in the observations.
    If there was a gap,
    was it long enough to take us into a
    different week?
</p>
<p>
    All of the timestamps roll over at the weekend,
    so if the handler is started on a weekday, it just needs a
    start time in the same week as the first message.
    If it's started close to any rollover, it may need a
    more accurate start time.
</p>


<h4>The Masks</h4>
<p>
    The masks in the header show how to
    unpack the data in the cells
    that follow
    The format is designed to
    minimise the bandwidth
    needed to carry the data cells that follow.
    It's very clever,
    but a little difficult to understand
</p>
<p>
    The MSM format
    supports up to 64 satellites in the constellation,
    numbered 1-64.
    The satellite mask is 64 bits long.
    For each of the satellites observed,
    a bit is set in the mask,
    the first bit for satellite 1,
    the last bit for satellite 64.
</p>
<p>
    For example,
    if the satellite mask is
</p>
<p>
    0101100000000010000101000000010000000000000000000000000000
</p>
<p>
    Bits 2, 4, 5 etc, seven bits in all are set in that mask,
    so signals were observed from those seven satellites,
    numbers 2, 4, 5 etc.
    That means there will be seven satellite cells
    later in the message.
    The first will contain data about satellite 2,
    the second will contain data about satellite 4, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    (When the bit string is viewed as a 64-bit integer,
    it's the other way round.
    The
    first bit in the bit stream is the top bit
    of the integer,
    bit 63.
    That
    represents satellite 1 and bit 0 represents satellite 64.)
</p>
<p>
    The signal mask is 32 bits, laid out in the same way,
    so the standard supports 32 types of signal numbered
    1-32.

    The RTCM standard defines the meaning of each signal type and
    the frequency that it's broadcast on.
    My base stations are dual-band,
    meaning they can only receive signals on two frequency bands.
    Signals can share the same band
    but it turns out that
    each band only offers
    one signal that I can receive.
    The upshot is that my base stations
    can only receive two signals
    from each satellite in any constellation.
</p>
<p>
    If the 32-bit signal mask is
</p>
<p>
    1000000000001000000000000000000
</p>
<p>
    Bits 1 and 13 are set which means that the base station
    observed signal types 1 from at least one of the
    satellites that it can see, and signal 13 from at least one,
    not necessarily the same one.
    It may have
    observed signal type 1 from one satellite,
    signal type 13 from another, signals of both types from a third,
    and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The cell mask shows what signals were
    actually observed (ie received) on this scan.
    It's variable length, nSignals X nSatellites bits long,
    where nSignals is the number of signal types
    that the base might observe
    from each satellite
    (two in my case)
    and nSatellites is the number
    of satellites (seven in this example).
    The cell mask is an array of bits with nSatellite elements of nSignals
    each,
    so with the satellite and signal masks as above,
    it will be 14 bits long. For example:
</p>
<p>
    01 11 11 10 10 10 10
</p>
<p>
    The first pair of bits 01 means that the
    base received signal thirteen from satellite 2
    but not signal one.
    The second pair 11 means that it observed
    both signals from satellite 4,
    and so on.
    Nine bits
    in the cell mask are set to 1
    so the signal cell list in the message should contain nine cells.
</p>
<p>
    The cell mask is the last field in the header.
    All the other fields are fixed length but the cell mask is
    variable length, so the header is variable length.
</p>
<h4>The Satellite Cells</h4>
<p>
    The list of satellite cells
    follows the header.
    The cells
    contain data about the satellites that sent the
    observed signals,
    including the approximate distance
    from the satellite to the base station.

</p>
<p>
    If the base station can receive
    two types of signal from the satellites
    in a constellation
    and on this scan it received,
    say,
    signals from seven satellites,
    there will be seven sets of satellite cells
    in the message.

</p>

<p>
    The header is followed by a list of satellite cells,
    then a list of signal cells, both variable length.
</p>
<p>
    The cells in an MSM7 message are bigger than the ones in an MSM4.
    Some of the fields are bigger and there are some extra fields.
</p>
<h4>MSM4 Satellite Cells</h4>
<p>
    The satellite cells follow
    the header
    and contain the data about satellites.
    The order of the data is
    not what a programmer might
    expect.
    (Not this programmer, at least.)
    The bit stream is divided into fields starting with
    <b><i>all of</i></b> the values of the first field,
    followed
    by all of the values of the second field, and so on.
</p>
If signals were observed from N satellites,
the satellite cell data will be:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>N whole milliseconds of the approximate range - 8 bit unsigned integers (invalid if 0xff)</li>
    <li>N fractional milliseconds of the approximate range - 10 bit unsigned integers</li>
</ul>
There's no invalid value for
the fractional part.
It's valid if the whole part is valid.
</p>
<h4>MSM4 Signal Cells</h4>
<p>
    The signal cells follow the satellite cells
    and the layout is similar.
    if there are M signal cells then
    the signal cell data will be:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>M range delta values - 15 bit signed integers (invalid if -16384)</li>
    <li>M phase range values - 22 bit signed integer (invalid if -2097152)</li>
    <li>M lock time values - 4 bit unsigned integer</li>
    <li>M half-cycle ambiguity values - 1 bit boolean</li>
    <li>M Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNR) values - 6 bit unsigned integer</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>MSM 7 Satellite Cells</h4>
<p>
    The MSM7 satellite cells contain
    all the fields of the MSM4 cells
    but some have more bits.
    There are also some extra
    fields in the MSM7 cells,
    including the phase range and the
    phase range rate.
</p>
<P>
    According to Blewitt's paper,
    the Phase range rate
    is the velocity at which the satellite is approaching the receiver (if positive) or moving away
    from it (if negative).
</p>
<p>
    If there are N satellites,
    the MSM7 satellite cell data are:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>N whole milliseconds of approximate range - 8 bit unsigned integers (invalid if 255)</li>
    <li>N extended information - 4 bit unsigned integers</li>
    <li>N fractional milliseconds of approximate range - 10 bit unsigned integers</li>
    <li>N phase range rate values - 14 bit signed integers (invalid if -8192)</li>
</ul>
The fractional value is invalid if the value of the whole milliseconds field is invalid.
</p>
<h4>The MSM7 Signal Cells</h4>

<p>
    If there are T signal cells,
    the signal
    cell data are:
<ul>
    <li>T range delta values - 20 bit signed integers (invalid if -524288)</li>
    <li>T phase range values - 24 bit signed integers (invalid if -8388608)</li>
    <li>T lock time values - 10 bit unsigned integers</li>
    <li>T half-cycle ambiguity values - 1 bit booleans</li>
    <li>T Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNR) values - 10 bit unsigned integers</li>
    <li>T phase range rate delta values - 15 bit signed integers (invalid if -16384)</li>
</ul>
The satellite cells contain the approximate
range value and the signal cells contain the delta
values.
</p>
<h4>Padding</h4>
<p>
    Unless the number of bits in the bit stream
    is an exact
    multiple of eight,
    a few extra zero bits are added at the end to pad it out.
    The base station can also add a few
    zero bytes as more padding.
    You can see that
    in the example.
</p>
<p>
    The next message frame starts immediately after
    any padding, with no intervening newline byte.
    That could be a few
    messages in a different format such as NMEA,
    or it could be another RTCM messages,
    signalled by the
    special 0xd3 byte.
