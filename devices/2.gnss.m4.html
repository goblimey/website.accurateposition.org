<h2>Navigation by Satellite</h2>
<p>
    To find its position using the
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
    a receiver on the ground receives radio signals
    from the navigation satellites and
    uses a bit of mathematics to find
    its
    position.
    It needs signals from 4 satellites to do that.
    A multi-constellation receiver can
    use
    signals from all of the constellation.
    Where I live,
    upwards of twenty satellites
    will be visible at any time
    (visible meaning that my equipment
    can detect the signals).
</p>
<p>
    The satellites broadcast radio
    signals of different types
    on different frequency bands.
    Each signal type gives
    different information,

    The cheaper GNSS receivers such as the one in a smartphone
    can only receive on one frequency band.
    More expensive <b><i>dual band</i></b> devices can
    receive on two frequency bands
    so can receive more types of signals.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the signals are encrypted and are
    used by government agencies such as the military and
    the emergency services.
    The UK government used to have access to the encrypted
    messages from the European Galileo satellites but
    when we left the European Union,
    we lost that access.
</p>
<p>
    In 1997 Geoffrey Blewitt of Newcastle University published his paper
    <a href="https://nbmg.unr.edu/staff/pdfs/blewitt%20basics%20of%20gps.pdf/">
        Basics of the GPS Technique: Observation Equations
    </a> explaining how GNSS systems work and how to achieve better accuracy with them.
    He's now a Professor at the
    Nevada Bureau of Mines and geology.
</p>
<p>
    Blewitt's paper describes some fairly advanced
    mathematical techniques.
    The equipment takes care of the calculations
    so you don't need to know anything about them
    to use a receiver,
    but some knowledge of what's going on helps,
    especially when things go wrong.
</p>
<p>
    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc1LBFDj2MA'>
        This YouTube video
    </a>
    is well worth watching.
    You should certainly do that before tackling Blewitt's paper.
    It explains the concepts in very simple terms.
    That YouTube page also gives links to notes
    explaining how to build your own GNSS receiver.
</p>

<p>
    Blewitt's paper is over twenty years old and things have changed a bit.
    There are now more <b><i>constellations</i></b> of navigation satellites.
    As well as the original Global Positioning System (GPS),
    the Glonass,
    Beidou
    and Galileo constellations are all running.
    Each of them covers the whole of the Earth.
    A receiver anywhere
    with a clear view of the sky
    should be able to see signals from some satellites
    from each of those constellations.
</p>
<p>
    The paper describes
    the Selective Accuracy (SA) feature,
    whereby
    the GPS signal was partly encrypted
    to restrict its accuracy for most users.
    This was turned off in the year 2000,
    so is no longer an issue.
</p>
<p>
    The paper describes a technique
    called Point Positioning (PP) that could be used
    to defeat Selective Accuracy
    and find a position within about three metres.
    With SA turned off, PP is redundant
    but a similar technique called
    Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
    is still used to post-process
    the results of a survey
    and correct them to centimetre accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    A number of organisations offer a free PPP
    service including
    <a href='https://webapp.csrs-scrs.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/geod/tools-outils/ppp.php'>this one</a>
    from
    the Canadian government's
    Natural Resources Canada.
</p>
<p>
    When using a PPP service to process a survey
    you must be aware of the reference frame
    in which the positions are embedded.
    At centimetre accuracy,
    the results will be different
    in each frame.
    Natural Resource Canada's service
    currently (2024)
    produces results in the ITRF2020/IGS20 frame.
</p>

<h3>Principles of GNSS</h3>
<p>
    The GNSS satellites follow elliptical orbits
    one focus of which is the centre of mass of the Earth.
    Each orbit takes one <b><i>sidereal day</i></b>,
    which is about 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds.
    (That's the time required for the Earth to rotate once
    relative to the background of the stars)
    Each satellite is always roughly 20,000 kilometres away
    from the surface of the Earth.

</p>
<p>
    An <b><i>ephemeris</i></b>
    (plural <b><i>ephemerides</i></b>)
    is a table giving the positions
    of objects in the sky such the planets
    and, nowadays,
    Earth-orbiting satellites.
    Each navigation satellite holds an ephemeris
    of its expected positions in the near future
    as it moves around its orbit.
</p>
<p>
    Each satellite carries an atomic clock,
    so it knows the time very accurately.
    It broadcasts a signal giving the time
    once every second, on the second.
    Less frequently it also broadcasts
    its ephemeris.
</p>

<p>
    A GNSS receiver with an equally accurate atomic clock
    could use the time signals from three satellites
    to find its position.
    The transit times of the signals
    and the speed of light in a vacuum
    give the distance to each satellite.
    The ephemerides give the position of each satellite.
    A bit of trigonometry gives the receiver its own position.
    To do this involves solving
    an equation with three unknowns,
    requiring three sets of input.
</p>

<p>
    Atomic clocks are big and expensive.
    A receiver that contains one will not be affordable
    or portable.
    The kind of receiver that
    I can afford takes
    the signals from four satellites
    and uses them to calculate
    both its position
    in three dimensions <b><i>and</i></b> the time.
    That involves solving a different equation with four unknowns
    and requiring four inputs.
</p>
<p></p>
Some people use a GNSS receiver
just to find the time very precisely.
The BBC uses GNSS to synchronise its equipment.
</p>
<p>
    So the technique to find your position and time
    depends on having an accurate ephemeris.
    If you turn a GNSS device off for a short time
    and then turn it back on again,
    it already has the ephemerides that needs
    and it starts to work immediately.
    If it's been turned off for a while,
    its ephemerides will be out of date
    and you have to wait until it picks up new ones.
    The ephemerides are also available over the Internet
    so if your receiver has Internet access,
    the process may be faster.
</p>
<h3>Centimetre-Accurate GNSS</h3>
<p>
    The technique described in Blewitt's paper
    uses an analysis of the carrier wave
    of the signal rather than its contents,
    so
    a receiver can make use of all the signals
    including types that it can't
    decrypt.
</p>

<p>
    The calculated distance to the satellite
    is called the <b><i>pseudorange</i></b>,
    pseudo because it's almost but not quite correct.
    The signal is distorted,
    particularly by the ionosphere,
    and often
    arrives at the receiver having been reflected off
    a wall or the side of a hill.
</p>
<p>
    The receiver calculates
    the pseudorange
    from the transit time of the signal.
    If two signal at different frequencies from the same satellite
    take different paths
    to the receiver,
    their journeys may take different times.
    So the pseudorange derived from one signal
    may be different from the range derived
    from another signal,
    even though they were sent from the same satellite at the same time.

</p>
<p>
    Another cause of error is that
    the satellites are never quite where the
    ephemeris says they should be,
    which causes another error.
    The GNSS ground stations
    monitor the real positions of the satellites
    and share the results.
    These can be used later by the PPP process to
    correct the positions recorded in a survey.
</p>
<p>
    It takes the various agencies about ten days to
    collate and publish the corrected satellite positions,
    To get centimetre accuracy
    from PPP post-processing
    you need to wait until the satellite data is
    ready before submitting
    your survey.
</p>

<p>
    The intensity of the GNSS radio signals is very low
    and fairly light cloud can cause serious reception
    problems.
    To get an accurate position fix,
    the receiver scans the signals for several seconds,
    sometimes several minutes if
    reception is poor.
</p>
<p>
    On its own, given
    clear signals from four satellites,
    a GNSS receiver can figure out its position to within
    about three metres.
    Receiving signals from more satellites
    allows a faster calculation but
    doesn't produce more accuracy.
</p>
<p>
    Three metre accuracy is acceptable for vehicle
    navigation
    but purposes such as land surveying require more.
</p>



<h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
<p>
    If your GNSS receiver is fixed in one position,
    you can use PPP to find its position
    once and for all accurate to two or three centimetres.
    It will then be subject to continental drift but
    that happens at a known rate and you can allow for it.
</p>
<p>
    PPP can also be used to post-process a survey
    done by a moving GNSS receiver (a <b><i>rover</i></b>),
    but you have to wait a couple of weeks for the result.
</p>
<p>
    You may have watched the fireworks and animated
    light shows celebrating
    King Charles' coronation.
    The animations were done using drones
    with lights mounted on them.
    Each drone has a GNSS receiver on board
    telling it where it is.
    If you're trying to drive a fleet of drones
    through a tightly choreographed sequence like that,
    you need centimeter accuracy in real time.
</p>
<p>
    Section 6 of Blewitt's paper shows how a moving rover
    can achieve that
    with the help
    of another GNSS receiver,
    a <b><i>base station</i></b>.
    The base station has to be
    fixed in a known position
    and it has to be a <b><i>dual-band</i></b> device,
    able to receive signals on two wavebands.
    The rover can be a cheaper single-band device.
    One base station can support many rovers.
</p>

<p>
    The base station
    broadcasts its position plus
    information about the signals it's receiving
    from the satellites.
    A rover close to it receives the same signals.
    It uses the data from the base
    and the signals that it's receiving
    from the satellites
    to make a very good estimate
    of its own position <b><i>relative to the base station</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
    As the rover gets further away from the base,
    it receives fewer of the same signals
    so the correction data becomes less useful.
    Eventually the rover reverts to
    its native accuracy of three metres.
</p>
<p>
    How far is too far
    depends on the equipment.
</p>
<p>
    The rover calculates its position
    relative to the position of the base,
    then adds that offset to the base's
    published position to find its own.
    So,
    the problem is moved to finding
    the position of the base accurately.
    If
    that's
    wrong by, say, 1.5m to the north,
    then each each rover using that base station will calculate positions that are
    wrong by the same amount.
    The positions in the resulting survey will be accurate relative to each other but they
    will each be shifted from their true position by 1.5m to the north.
</p>

<p>
    Since the coordinates of any position assumes some
    Terrestrial
    Reference Frame (TRF),
    and the rover works out its position
    relative to the position given by the base station,
    it also inherits whichever
    TRF
    the base is using.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand,
    the rover doesn't inherit its geoid model
    from the base station.
    The base station doesn't have a geoid model.
    It just has a fixed position configured into it
    and publishes a data stream containing that
    and its satellite observations.
</p>
<h3>Real-Time Kinematics</h3>
<p>
    The technique of using a base station to help a rover find
    its position accurately is called Real-Time Kinetics (RTK).
    In any RTK solution
    the base station transmits a stream of satellite observations
    through some medium
    and the rover receives and uses them.
</p>
<p>
    The RTCM protocol was designed to support an RTK stream.
    The standard is just named after the body that produced it -
    the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services.
    RTCM specifies the formats of a set of
    messages that can be used to transmit
    observations of satellite signals from a base station to a rover.
</p>
<p>
    You can use Long Range Radio (LoRa)
    to broadcast RTCM messages.
    LoRa devices work over several kilometres given
    good conditions but
    the frequencies they are allowed to use are limited.
    Other types of device use them and
    and there doesn't seem to be a way to pair
    a transmitter and receiver.
    I don't know what would happen
    if there were two LoRa devices in the vicinity,
    each broadcasting RTCM on the same frequency.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of using LoRa,
    a base and rover can communicate over the Internet
    using a protocol such as NTRIP (described later).
    To use NTRIP
    the base and rover both need an Internet connection.
    The rover can use a nearby smart phone
    to supply its Internet connection
    via a WiFi hotspot.
    The fixed base can use an ordinary home or office
    broadband connection,
    or a phone,
    depending on what's available.

</p>
<p>
    To allow the base and rover to
    find each other,
    the NTRIP protocol uses an intermediary
    called a <b><i>caster</i></b>,
    a specialist web server
    that takes the data from a base station
    and sends it to one or more rovers.
</p>
<p>
    NTRIP is based on standard web protocols
    and the caster is really just a streaming web server,
    similar in concept to the one that
    Netflix uses to stream
    TV programmes to your phone.
</p>
<p>
    I publish an open-source NTRIP caster
    that's very easy to install and configure.
    You ned equipment to run it on but
    you an hire that can run it for $8 per month.
    More on that later.
</p>

<h3>Accurate GNSS on a Budget</h3>
<p>
    The component manufacturer U-Blox makes a single-chip
    device
    <a href='https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/zed-f9p-module'>the ZED-F9P</a>
    which supplies everything needed
    to build a dual-band base station that can decipher the signals
    from GPS, Glonass, Beidou, Galileo and other constellations.
    Various manufacturers package up this
    chip into complete working devices.
</p>
<p>
    Sparkfun make a number of GNSS receivers
    using the ZED-F9P,
    including raw circuit boards
    and packaged devices such as
    <a href='https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18443'>
        the RTK Surveyor
    </a>.
    The packaged devices cost $400 to $500
    including a dual-band antenna.
</p>
<p>
    Emlid makes a base station
    <a href='https://emlid.com/reachrs2plus/'>the Reach RS+</a>
    which has more useful features
    than Sparkfun's devices
    but costs about $2000.
</p>
<p>
    Emlid also makes a single-band rover
    <a href='https://innovelec.co.uk/products/emlid-rch102-reach-m-rtk-gnss-module/'>
        the Reach M+
    </a>.
    This is
    about the size of a matchbox
    but requires a separate battery and antenna.
    The battery can be a standard mobile phone booster.
    The complete working set will cost about $300,
    depending on how big a phone booster you use -
    a bigger one will run the device for longer but
    will be more expensive and heavier.
</p>
<p>
    The M+ device was originally designed to
    fit inside a drone and work
    with Emlid's
    <a href='https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/'>Navio</a>
    drone flight controller.

    To turn it into a survey device,
    mount it on a pole along with the battery and antenna,
    and drive it using a mobile phone
    as a display.
</p>
<p>
    Assuming that you already own a smartphone,
    you can use a Sparkfun RTK surveyor as a base,
    an Emlid Reach M+ as a rover
    and the open-source NTRIP caster
    to connect the two.
    That gives you a working centimetre-accurate
    GNSS system for
    less than $1,000.
</p>
<p>
    At present (2024)
    I can find the M+ receiver on resellers' websites
    but not on the Emlid website,
    so Emlid may be in the process of withdrawing
    that product.
    They seem to be concentrating on their new
    <a href='https://emlid.com/reach/'>Reach M2</a>,
    a dual-band receiver
    supplied in the same tiny package
    as the M+
    but costing a bit more.
    It might be possible to use this device
    as a base station as well as a rover,
    but I haven't bought one and tried it,
    so I can't say.
